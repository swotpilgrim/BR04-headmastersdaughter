It wasn't random vandalism—he defaced a statue of his previous school's founder who had documented racist history.

**Beats:**
1. Noah's friends from his previous boarding school visit Riverside for the weekend. Kelsey observes them on campus—they're louder, more reckless in demeanor than Riverside students, joking about Noah's "exile" and clearly not fitting the formal Riverside culture.
2. At Saturday dinner in the dining hall, Noah sits with his visiting friends. They push boundaries with inappropriate jokes and disrespectful comments about Riverside traditions, making other students uncomfortable. Dean Patterson watches the table with obvious disapproval.
3. Kelsey sees a different side of Noah—how he was at his old school, more comfortable with chaos and rebellion. She's troubled by this version of him but also understands he's navigating complex social dynamics with old friends.
4. After dinner, Noah's friends attempt to sneak alcohol into North Hall dormitory. Campus security catches them at the entrance gate with bottles in their bags. There's a significant incident with security, Dean Patterson, and eventually Dr. Morrison involved.
5. Noah is questioned extensively since they're his guests and he signed them in. He's cleared because he wasn't involved in the attempt and had actually told them not to bring anything inappropriate, but the association damages his reputation further. Students assume the worst. From the headmaster's residence, Kelsey watches the incident unfold and is deeply worried about how this will affect Noah's probation status and standing.

**Dialogue Topics:** Noah's friends making jokes about his expulsion and Riverside's formal culture. Dinner table conversation that crosses appropriate boundaries.
