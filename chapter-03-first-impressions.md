# Chapter 3: First Impressions

Mr. Webb's English classroom was still filling with students when the announcement came over the intercom: all seniors were to report to the Morrison Hall assembly room immediately for orientation. I exchanged glances with Meredith as we gathered our things. The original schedule had orientation at eleven, not nine-thirty.

"Wonder what changed," Meredith said as we joined the stream of students heading downstairs.

"Maybe something to do with the transfer student." The announcement from breakfast was still on my mind. A senior transfer was unusual enough to warrant adjustment to the schedule.

Morrison Hall's assembly room was already half-full when we arrived. The space always felt formal to me—wood-paneled walls hung with Riverside banners representing each graduating class, tall windows overlooking the quad, the small stage at the front where student council sat during official events. This was where my father gave his important speeches, where tradition and ceremony happened.

"Come on," Meredith said, heading for seats in the middle section.

"I can't." I gestured toward the stage where other student council members were gathering. "I have to sit up there."

"Right. Forgot you were part of the official welcoming committee." She squeezed my arm. "Try not to look too perfect. It intimidates people."

I climbed the steps to the stage and took my assigned seat between Marcus Chen, the student council president, and Sarah Williams, the vice president. We were meant to represent Riverside's student leadership, which meant sitting with perfect posture in our blazers while the rest of the senior class got to relax in the audience.

Through the windows, I watched more students arriving. The September morning was beautiful, sunlight golden on the brick buildings, but I felt separated from it by glass and expectation.

"Big year ahead," Marcus said, adjusting his blazer. He was the kind of student who'd been groomed for leadership since freshman year—legacy family, impeccable grades, heading to Princeton in the fall. "Dr. Morrison wants us to set the tone for excellence."

"When doesn't he?" Sarah asked dryly, but she smiled to show she was joking.

The assembly room filled completely. Every senior at Riverside—about a hundred students—finding seats, greeting friends they hadn't seen over summer break, the particular energy of first-day-of-school reunion. I spotted Meredith sitting with some debate team members, Tyler Bradford with the soccer players, clusters of friends reforming after months apart.

My father entered through the side door, and the room's noise level dropped automatically. He had that effect—not through intimidation exactly, but through the weight of his position. Twelve years as Riverside's headmaster had given him an authority that didn't require raising his voice.

He took his position at the podium, arranging his notes while the room settled into complete silence. I straightened my posture, aware that students would notice how I behaved during my father's speech, would judge whether I was appropriately attentive or inappropriately casual.

"Good morning, seniors." His voice carried easily through the room. "Welcome back to Riverside Academy, and welcome to what I trust will be your most significant year yet."

The speech was familiar—I'd heard variations of it for years. The importance of senior year, the responsibility of being role models for younger students, the tradition of Riverside excellence stretching back to 1890. He spoke about college applications and the weight they carried, about maintaining the academic and behavioral standards that made Riverside's reputation, about how this class would carry the school's name into the world.

He was good at this, I had to admit. Inspiring without being preachy, serious without being humorless. The students listened attentively, responding to his expectation of respect.

"And now," my father said, "I'd like to invite your student council secretary, Kelsey Morrison, to offer some welcoming remarks from your peer leadership."

I stood, smoothing my skirt, and crossed to the podium. My father stepped aside, giving me an encouraging nod that was just for me, before taking a seat with the other faculty members along the side wall.

The entire senior class looked at me. I'd done this before—spoken in front of assemblies, delivered prepared remarks—but it never got easier. They weren't looking at Kelsey. They were looking at the headmaster's daughter, analyzing whether I deserved my position or whether it was nepotism.

I placed my notes on the podium and took a breath.

"Good morning, everyone. On behalf of the student council, I want to welcome you back and welcome you to senior year." My voice was steady, confident. I'd practiced this speech. "This year is unique. We're no longer the new students learning Riverside's traditions—we're the ones responsible for upholding them and passing them on."

I continued through my prepared remarks. The importance of community, the value of supporting each other through college applications and academic pressure, the privilege of being part of Riverside's long history. I talked about the senior activities planned for the year—fall formal, winter semiformal, senior trip in the spring. I reminded everyone about academic integrity and the honor code we'd all signed.

It was a good speech. Appropriate, sincere without being sappy, hitting all the right notes about tradition and excellence and community. I'd written it carefully, revised it three times, made sure it represented the school well.

But halfway through, I noticed someone in the back row who clearly wasn't buying any of it.

He sat slouched in his chair, arms crossed, expression somewhere between boredom and skepticism. Dark hair slightly too long to be regulation, a navy blazer that looked new—probably purchased specifically for Riverside's dress code—and an air of complete disconnection from the proceedings.

The transfer student. Had to be.

I stumbled slightly over my next sentence, distracted by his obvious disinterest. Everyone else in the room was at least pretending to listen attentively. He looked like he was counting ceiling tiles.

I finished my speech—"Thank you, and here's to an excellent senior year"—and returned to my seat while the room offered polite applause. Marcus leaned over and whispered, "Well done," but I was still watching the back row.

The new student hadn't clapped at all.

My father returned to the podium. "Thank you, Kelsey. Excellent remarks." He scanned the room, and I saw the moment his eyes landed on the back row. "I'd also like to take this opportunity to officially welcome a new member of your senior class. Noah Bennett is joining us as a transfer student from Choate, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome here at Riverside."

The room shifted, students turning in their seats to locate the new kid. I saw Noah—that had to be his name—tense slightly, his casual slouch becoming more defensive.

"Noah," my father continued, his tone warm and inclusive, "would you mind standing and introducing yourself to your classmates?"

It was meant kindly, I knew that. My father believed in making new students feel immediately included, in breaking down the barrier between newcomer and community. But I watched Noah's face and saw something else—the forced public exposure, the spotlight he clearly didn't want.

He stood slowly, and I got a better look at him. Tall, probably just over six feet, with an angular face and dark eyes that held no warmth. He looked at my father for a long moment before turning to face the room.

"I'm Noah Bennett." His voice was flat, giving away nothing. "I'm from Connecticut."

The room waited for more. Students always elaborated—talked about their interests, their excitement about Riverside, something personal and friendly. Noah just stood there, clearly finished.

The silence stretched uncomfortably. My father maintained his encouraging expression, waiting for Noah to continue. Noah didn't.

"Well," my father finally said, "thank you, Noah. We're glad to have you."

Noah sat down without acknowledging the response. The room buzzed with whispered reactions—curious, judgmental, entertained by the awkwardness. I saw Marcus and Sarah exchange meaningful glances. This new student had just made a memorable first impression, and not a positive one.

My father continued with the rest of orientation—reviewing important dates, academic expectations, reminders about school rules and residential life policies. But I kept glancing toward the back row, where Noah sat in the same defensive posture, looking like he wanted to be anywhere else.

What had happened at Choate? Transfer students didn't usually radiate that much hostility and disconnection. He looked like someone who expected to fail, who'd already decided Riverside wouldn't work out.

Or like someone who'd been hurt and was protecting himself the only way he knew how.

The assembly concluded with my father's final remarks about making this "a year to remember" and upholding Riverside's proud traditions. Students stood, stretching and immediately resuming conversations. The student council remained on stage while my father approached.

"Kelsey, could I have a word?" He gestured toward the side of the stage, away from the other council members.

I followed him, already knowing what he was going to ask.

"Noah Bennett seems to be having some difficulty adjusting," my father said quietly. "I'd like you to give him a campus tour this afternoon, show him where everything is, help him feel more welcome."

Of course he would ask me. I was the perfect daughter, the responsible one, the student who could be trusted to set the right example.

"I have debate team practice at three," I said.

"This shouldn't take long. Perhaps right after lunch? Just the major buildings, dining hall procedures, where his classes are. Help him feel less..." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "Less antagonistic toward being here."

I wanted to say no. I wanted to point out that Noah Bennett had made it perfectly clear he didn't want help or inclusion. But my father was looking at me with that expression that meant this was important, that he was counting on me.

"Okay," I said. "I'll meet him after lunch."

"Thank you, Kelsey. I knew I could count on you." He squeezed my shoulder briefly before turning to speak with Marcus about student council business.

I descended from the stage and found Meredith waiting by the door.

"So you get to babysit the angry new kid?" she asked. "I could hear your dad from my seat."

"Campus tour. It's not babysitting."

"He looked thrilled to be here."

"He looked like he wanted to set the building on fire," I corrected. "This should be fun."

We walked out into the September sunshine, and I tried not to think about spending my afternoon showing around someone who clearly had no interest in Riverside, in belonging here, or in anything I might have to say.

But I'd agreed, because that's what I did. I was the headmaster's daughter.

And the headmaster's daughter always did what was asked of her, even when she didn't want to.
