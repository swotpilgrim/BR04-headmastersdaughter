# Chapter 10: Midterm Project Presentation

The following Wednesday, I woke with nervous energy thrumming through my veins. Today was our civil disobedience debate presentation in Mr. Webb's class. Noah and I had spent Sunday afternoon finalizing our arguments, practicing transitions, making sure we could handle Q&A from classmates. The work was solid—I knew that intellectually. But presenting meant public performance, and public performance involving Noah meant inviting more scrutiny and judgment.

Meredith noticed my tension at breakfast. "You're going to be great. You've prepared thoroughly, and your partnership with Noah is genuinely strong work."

"I know. I just wish the presentation existed in a vacuum instead of being part of the ongoing Riverside gossip entertainment."

"Ignore them. Show everyone why Mr. Webb paired you two in the first place."

Easy to say, harder to execute.

In English class, I took my usual front-row seat. Noah arrived and caught my eye, giving a small nod. We'd agreed to sit separately before the presentation to avoid appearing too familiar, though that ship had probably sailed weeks ago.

Mr. Webb began class by explaining presentation format. Each partnership would present for fifteen minutes, then handle questions for five. He'd evaluate both content and collaborative dynamic. Three partnerships would present today, including ours.

We were scheduled last.

I sat through the first two presentations barely absorbing content, mentally reviewing our opening arguments and transition points. Tyler and Marcus presented on the ethics of hacktivism—solid work, though Marcus dominated while Tyler deferred too much. Meredith and Sarah tackled whistleblowing in corporate contexts with their typical brilliance, generating genuine class discussion about loyalty versus transparency.

Then: "Kelsey and Noah, you're up."

We moved to the front of the room. Noah set up our visual aids while I arranged our note cards on the podium. The class watched with obvious interest—this wasn't just another presentation. This was the headmaster's daughter and the expelled transfer student, whose partnership had generated weeks of gossip.

I refused to let that affect our work.

"Our presentation examines environmental activism and civil disobedience," I began, my voice steady and clear. "Specifically, we're analyzing pipeline protests where activists trespass on private property to prevent construction they believe threatens land and water resources."

Noah picked up smoothly. "The central question is how we balance property rights, legal process, and environmental protection when activists believe the legal system itself is insufficient to address urgent threats."

We'd structured the presentation as a genuine debate—I argued the case for civil disobedience as moral imperative, Noah argued for working within legal systems. But we'd crafted it so neither position dominated, forcing the class to wrestle with complexity rather than accept easy answers.

As we moved through our arguments, I felt us falling into the rhythm we'd developed during library sessions. Noah would make a point about legal frameworks and institutional processes, I'd counter with the inadequacy of those frameworks when systems moved too slowly to address urgent threats. I'd present case studies of successful protest movements that achieved change through disruption, he'd highlight cases where protest alienated potential allies and hardened opposition instead of building coalitions.

Our chemistry was evident—we built on each other's points naturally, finishing each other's thoughts without stepping on toes, creating genuine intellectual tension without it becoming adversarial or performative. The arguments flowed, each of us listening actively and responding to what the other actually said rather than just waiting for our turn to speak.

This was what Mr. Webb had wanted when he paired us: partnership that challenged both participants, pushed toward sophistication, and demonstrated that disagreement could be productive rather than destructive.

"The Dakota Access Pipeline protests demonstrate this tension clearly," I said, clicking to our visual showing the Standing Rock encampment. "Activists argued that legal processes had failed to protect sacred sites and water sources. The question became whether trespass was justified given institutional failure."

Noah nodded. "But we also have to consider effectiveness. Did the trespass change policy, or did it primarily create spectacle? When does direct action actually achieve goals versus simply expressing frustration?"

"Sometimes expression of frustration is itself important," I countered. "Making injustice visible, refusing to accept business as usual, creating moral urgency that legal processes ignore—these have value beyond immediate policy change."

"Agreed. But there's a difference between strategic disruption and symbolic gesture. How do we evaluate which protests deserve support versus criticism?"

The class was engaged now, several students taking notes, Mr. Webb leaning forward with obvious interest. Even Sloane was paying attention, though her expression was harder to read.

We moved into our final synthesis, where we acknowledged the genuine difficulty of the question.

"There's no universal answer," Noah said. "Context matters. Institutional responsiveness matters. Stakes matter. What's justified civil disobedience in one situation might be counterproductive in another."

"Which means," I continued, "that we can't simply default to either 'always follow the law' or 'always prioritize conscience over law.' We have to evaluate specific situations with nuance, recognize trade-offs, and accept that reasonable people will disagree about where lines should be drawn."

We concluded together, a technique we'd practiced: "Civil disobedience exists in the space between perfect legal systems and imperfect moral individuals. Understanding when and how to occupy that space requires exactly the kind of critical thinking this assignment demands."

The class was quiet for a moment after we finished. Then Mr. Webb started applauding, and the rest of the class joined. Not polite obligatory clapping—genuine appreciation.

"Excellent work," Mr. Webb said. "That was exactly the level of intellectual rigor and genuine debate I hoped to see. Questions from the class?"

Several hands went up. Tyler asked about specific legal precedents. Meredith challenged our framework for evaluating effectiveness. Marcus questioned whether environmental activism specifically warranted different analysis than other protest contexts.

We fielded questions easily, our preparation evident. Noah handled technical legal questions, I addressed philosophical and ethical dimensions, and we both contributed to discussion about practical applications.

Then Sloane raised her hand.

"This is maybe more meta than content," she said sweetly, "but I'm curious about your process. How did you navigate such different perspectives? Because from what I understand, Noah has pretty strong personal experience with civil disobedience, while Kelsey obviously has to be more cautious given her position. How did you find common ground?"

The question was designed to highlight our differences, to remind everyone of Noah's expulsion and my complicated position. But I refused to let it derail us.

"Our different perspectives strengthened the work," I said calmly. "Civil disobedience is complicated specifically because it involves genuine values tension. Having partnership members who approach the question from different starting points forced us to engage with complexity rather than defaulting to easy positions."

Noah added, "And honestly, the process showed me that someone who follows rules closely can still understand principled rule-breaking, while someone who's broken rules can still respect legal frameworks. The binary between rule-followers and rule-breakers is less clear than it appears."

Mr. Webb nodded approvingly. "Excellent response. Any other questions?"

A few more, mostly substantive, then our time concluded. We returned to our seats while Mr. Webb offered feedback. He praised our research depth, argumentative structure, presentation chemistry, and willingness to genuinely wrestle with difficulty rather than oversimplifying.

"This is what intellectual partnership should look like," he said. "You challenged each other, built on each other's strengths, and produced something more sophisticated than either of you could have created alone."

After class, several students approached with comments. Tyler congratulated Noah enthusiastically, admitting he'd been skeptical about how we'd work together but was impressed by the result. Meredith squeezed my arm and whispered, "Told you it would be great. That was actually brilliant."

Even Marcus acknowledged it had been strong work, though he still looked concerned about the optics of my partnership with Noah. Sarah complimented our presentation chemistry, though I caught the meaningful look she exchanged with another student council member.

But most significant was Mr. Webb pulling us aside as students filed out.

"That was genuinely impressive work," he said. "I paired you deliberately because I thought you'd push each other, but you exceeded my expectations. Have you considered submitting this for the regional ethics debate competition? It's exactly the level they're looking for."

Noah and I exchanged glances.

"We'd have to expand it," I said.

"And coordinate schedules for competition prep," Noah added.

"Think about it," Mr. Webb encouraged. "I think you'd represent Riverside well."

Walking out of class, I felt lighter than I had in days. The presentation had been excellent. We'd proven our partnership was academically strong, not just gossip fodder. Mr. Webb's praise was genuine and earned.

"That felt good," Noah said as we headed down the hallway.

"Really good. All that preparation paid off."

"Library celebration this afternoon? We could actually work on something other than this project for once."

I smiled. "Library at four. I'll bring coffee."

"Deal."

We separated to different classes, but I caught Sloane watching us from near her locker. Her expression suggested calculation rather than defeat. The gossip wouldn't stop because of one good presentation. But for the first time, I didn't care as much.

Let them talk. Noah and I had just demonstrated exactly why Mr. Webb paired us: we made each other better.

And that was worth every whispered comment and speculative glance Riverside wanted to throw at us.
