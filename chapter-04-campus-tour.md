# Chapter 4: Campus Tour

I found Noah Bennett waiting outside Morrison Hall at one o'clock, leaning against the brick wall with his hands in his pockets and an expression that suggested he'd rather be anywhere else.

"Hi," I said. "I'm Kelsey Morrison. My father asked me to show you around campus."

"I know who you are." His tone was flat. "You gave the speech this morning. About tradition and excellence and community."

Heat crept up my neck. He made it sound ridiculous. "Right. Well, I'm supposed to show you where everything is."

"Great. Let's get this over with."

I reminded myself that my father had asked me to make Noah feel welcome, even if Noah seemed determined to resist.

"Morrison Hall is the main academic building," I began. "Most of your classes will be here. Sciences on the first floor, humanities on the second and third."

"Got it. What's next?"

I led him across the quad toward the library, aware of students watching us. I kept my expression neutral, pretending I didn't notice the attention.

"That's Whitman Library," I said, pointing to the three-story building with tall windows reflecting the afternoon sun. "It's open until eleven on weeknights, one a.m. during exam periods. There are study rooms you can reserve on the third floor, and the basement has archives and historical collections."

"Do people actually use it, or is it just for show?" Noah asked.

I stopped walking. "Of course people use it. It's a library."

"Just asking."

"You'll probably spend a lot of time there senior year. Research papers, college applications, studying."

"Can't wait."

I turned and continued walking toward the dining hall. He followed a few steps behind, maintaining distance.

Riverside Commons looked less imposing in the afternoon light, its tall windows bright and welcoming. "This is the dining hall," I explained. "Breakfast is seven to eight-thirty, lunch is noon to one, dinner is six to seven-thirty. You have an assigned house table—it should be on your housing paperwork. That's where you'll sit for formal dinners."

"Assigned seating?" For the first time, he sounded genuinely surprised rather than just cynical. "Seriously?"

"It's a Riverside tradition. Each dorm has a house table, helps build community within your residential group. Dinner is formal—you need to wear your blazer and actually sit down, not just grab food and leave."

"Like we're in 1950 or something."

"Like we're part of a community with traditions," I corrected, probably more sharply than necessary. "If you wanted a school without structure, you picked the wrong place."

He looked at me for a long moment, and I couldn't read his expression. Then: "I didn't pick this place at all."

The honesty in that statement caught me off-guard. Before I could respond, he was already walking toward the next building on the tour route, ending the conversation.

I showed him the gymnasium and athletic facilities, then the student center, and finally the residential halls.

"North Hall is where you're living," I said, gesturing to the brick dormitory. "Boys' housing. South Hall is for girls. Curfew is eleven on weeknights, midnight on weekends. Sign-out procedures for leaving campus are in your student handbook."

"Which I'm sure I'll read cover to cover," Noah said.

"You should, actually. Dean Patterson doesn't have much tolerance for rule violations, and ignorance isn't an excuse."

Something shifted in his expression—defensiveness, maybe, or resignation. "Yeah, I got the full lecture this morning. One strike and I'm out."

So that's what this attitude was about. He was on probation, living under threat of immediate expulsion. No wonder he seemed hostile and disconnected.

We walked in silence past the dormitories and toward the edge of campus where the maintained grounds gave way to more natural landscaping. Trees grew thicker here, and I could hear the river moving beyond them.

"This last part isn't really official," I said, "but it's probably the most important stop on the tour."

Noah raised an eyebrow but didn't comment.

I led him down a narrow path between oak trees, their leaves just beginning to show hints of autumn color. The path opened onto a small clearing by the Pemigewasset River—Lakeside Point, though most students just called it The Point. It was one of the few places on campus that felt natural rather than manicured, wild rather than controlled.

The river moved past in easy current, sunlight catching on the water. A few flat rocks near the shore made natural seating, and the trees provided cover from the rest of campus. It was quiet here, private in a way that was rare at Riverside.

"This is where students come when they need to escape," I explained. "It's technically on campus, so you're not breaking curfew or sign-out rules. But it's far enough from everything that you can actually be alone."

Noah walked closer to the water's edge, and for the first time that afternoon, his defensive posture relaxed slightly.

"Does everyone know about this spot?" he asked.

"Most students. But there's an unspoken agreement—if someone's here alone, you leave them alone."

He nodded. "Why are you showing me this?"

I considered my answer carefully.

"Because you looked like you needed to know there's somewhere to breathe," I said honestly. "Riverside can be... intense. Especially if you're trying to figure out where you fit."

He turned to look at me, really look at me, for the first time since the tour began. "Do you fit?"

The question caught me completely off-guard. "What?"

"You're the headmaster's daughter. You gave that perfect speech this morning about tradition and community. You're showing the new kid around because your father asked you to. But do you actually fit here? Or are you just better at pretending than I am?"

No one had ever asked me that. In seventeen years of living at Riverside, not a single person had questioned whether I belonged or whether my performance was genuine.

"I don't have much choice," I heard myself say. "Everyone watches me. Everything I do reflects on my father. I can't afford to not fit."

"That sounds exhausting."

"It is." The admission surprised me. I didn't usually say things like that out loud, especially not to someone I barely knew.

Noah was quiet for a moment, still watching me with those dark, assessing eyes. "At least people expect good things from you. Everyone's just waiting for me to screw up. Again."

"Again?" I asked before I could stop myself.

"Choate. I got expelled." He said it matter-of-factly, like he was used to the confession. "Made a mistake, paid for it. Now I'm here on probation, one infraction away from being kicked out again. So yeah, everyone's waiting for me to fail. Including your father's attack dog Patterson."

I should have been shocked or judgmental. The headmaster's daughter should probably disapprove of students who got expelled from prestigious boarding schools. But instead, I just felt tired.

"That's why you were so hostile during the assembly," I said.

"What's the point of trying to make a good impression? They've already decided who I am."

I understood that feeling more than he could know. Being pre-judged, having your identity assigned before you had a chance to define it yourself. We were experiencing opposite versions of the same problem—he was expected to be bad, I was expected to be perfect, and neither of us got to just be ourselves.

"For what it's worth," I said, "I haven't decided who you are."

He looked surprised by that, his cynical armor cracking slightly. "You're the headmaster's daughter. You're supposed to set a good example and stay away from trouble."

"Probably." I sat down on one of the flat rocks by the water, suddenly not wanting to maintain the formal tour-guide distance. "But you asked if I always do what my father tells me. Honestly? Usually, yes. Because it's easier than fighting it. But that doesn't mean I think it's fair that you're being judged before anyone knows you."

Noah stood there for a moment, seeming to weigh whether to believe me. Then he sat down on another rock a few feet away, close enough for conversation but maintaining some space.

"Thanks," he said quietly. "For showing me this place. And for... not assuming."

"You're welcome." I watched the river move past, the water catching afternoon light. "The tour's officially over, by the way. I showed you all the major buildings. If you want to head back, you can."

"What if I want to stay here for a bit?"

"Then stay. That's what this place is for."

We sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, the only sound the river and wind moving through the trees. It was peaceful in a way I hadn't expected, sharing space with someone without the pressure of performance or judgment.

"Can I ask you something?" Noah said finally.

"Sure."

"That speech this morning—did you actually mean any of it? The stuff about community and belonging?"

I thought about lying, about giving the expected answer. But something about this place, about his honesty, made me want to be truthful.

"I meant the idea of it," I said slowly. "I think community and belonging matter. I just don't know if I've ever actually experienced them. It's hard to feel like you belong when everyone sees you as the headmaster's daughter instead of just... me."

He nodded like he understood. "Hard to belong when everyone sees you as the screw-up instead of someone who made one mistake for good reasons."

"Good reasons?" I asked, curious despite myself.

"Long story. Maybe I'll tell you sometime." He stood, brushing off his khakis. "I should probably go figure out where my actual classes are before tomorrow. Don't want to start my probation with tardiness."

I stood too. "Your schedule has the room numbers. Morrison Hall has a directory on the first floor if you get lost."

"Got it." He started back toward the path, then paused. "Kelsey?"

It was the first time he'd used my name.

"Yeah?"

"Thanks. This helped."

I smiled, a real smile. "You're welcome."

He almost smiled back—not quite, but close. Then he headed up the path toward campus.

I stood by the river, surprised by the afternoon. I'd been assigned to show the hostile transfer student around campus.

Instead, I'd had the most honest conversation I'd experienced in years.
