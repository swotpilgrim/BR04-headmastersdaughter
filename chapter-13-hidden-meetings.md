# Chapter 13: Hidden Meetings

The following week, Noah and I became more strategic about our meetings. After my conversation with my father, I understood the scrutiny wouldn't disappear, but I also wasn't going to hide our friendship completely. We found a middle ground—less obvious about our time together without actually stopping.

We met in the library's less visible corners, third-floor carrels tucked between the stacks where casual observation was unlikely. We timed our arrivals at Lakeside Point for when other students were occupied with athletics or activities. In hallways and dining hall, we kept interactions professional—polite nods, brief exchanges, nothing that invited commentary.

Despite the secrecy, or maybe because of it, our connection deepened.

Tuesday afternoon, library third floor, I found Noah already settled in a remote study carrel. He'd brought his sketchbook along with class materials.

"What are you working on?" I asked, settling into the adjacent carrel.

"Just sketching. Helps me think." He angled the notebook so I could see—detailed architectural drawing of Morrison Hall, perspective perfect, shading creating depth and texture.

"Noah, this is really good."

"Thanks. I used to want to study architecture before my parents decided that wasn't practical enough." He flipped to another page showing the library's exterior, intricate brick patterns and window details rendered carefully.

"These are beautiful. You should pursue this."

"Maybe. If I survive senior year and actually get into college somewhere." He closed the sketchbook. "How was the family dinner Sunday?"

I'd texted him briefly about the conversation with my father but hadn't elaborated. "Complicated. My dad's still concerned about your influence on my pristine reputation, but he also kind of acknowledged that he's been putting too much pressure on me to be perfect."

"That sounds like progress."

"It is. He even admitted he watched our debate presentation. Said we did excellent work."

Noah smiled. "So I'm academically acceptable if socially questionable?"

"Something like that. He asked me to be careful, protect myself, not ignore warning signs." I paused. "Which implies he thinks you're a warning sign."

"Fair assessment given my track record."

"It's not fair. You've been nothing but thoughtful and genuine since you got here."

"Kelsey, I spray-painted a statue and got expelled. Your dad's not wrong to be cautious."

"But he's judging you for one action without understanding the full context or seeing who you actually are."

Noah was quiet for a moment, doodling absently in the margin of his notebook. "Can I tell you something?"

"Always."

"Sometimes I worry he's right. Not about me being dangerous or whatever, but about me complicating your life. You've worked so hard to maintain this perfect record, and associating with me invites all this scrutiny and gossip. Maybe it would be easier for you if we weren't friends."

I moved from my carrel to perch on the edge of his desk, forcing him to look at me directly. "Do you actually think that? Or are you trying to pre-emptively reject me before I decide you're too complicated?"

He looked surprised. "That's... uncomfortably perceptive."

"I know defensive patterns. I've been running my own version my entire life."

"Fair." Noah set down his pen. "I guess I'm used to being the problem people eventually regret associating with. Trying to spare you the regret."

"Well, stop. You're not a problem I'm going to regret. You're the first genuine friend I've made who sees me instead of my father's position. That's valuable enough to deal with gossip."

"Your father might not agree."

"My father will adjust. He's already started." I slid back into my own carrel. "Now stop trying to noble-sacrifice our friendship and help me with this History reading. The Reconstruction chapter is putting me to sleep."

We worked for the next hour, occasionally sharing interesting facts or debating historical interpretations. Noah had a way of connecting past events to current issues that made everything more relevant and engaging. I was actually enjoying History homework, which never happened.

Around five, my phone buzzed. Text from Meredith: *Student council emergency meeting in 10 minutes. Mandatory. Sorry.*

I groaned. "I have to go. Student council crisis du jour."

"What's the crisis?"

"No idea. Probably Fall Formal decoration drama or budget allocation argument. The usual."

Noah started packing his things too. "I should head out anyway. Tyler wanted to grab dinner before the soccer game tonight."

We left the library separately—I exited first, Noah waiting a few minutes before following. The precaution felt silly but necessary given the attention we'd been drawing.

The student council meeting was indeed about Fall Formal, specifically about whether we had budget for a photo booth rental. The discussion went in circles for forty-five minutes before Marcus made an executive decision. I contributed appropriately, took notes as secretary, and tried not to think about how much more interesting the library conversation had been.

After the meeting, Meredith caught up with me walking back to South Hall.

"You were at the library before this, weren't you?"

"Studying for History."

"With Noah."

I didn't bother denying it. "Yes, with Noah. We're both in Mr. Webb's class, we study similar subjects, it makes sense to work together."

"I'm not judging. I'm just saying be careful. Sloane was asking pointed questions at lunch about whether you two are dating."

"We're not dating. We're friends who occasionally study together."

"I know that. You know that. But the optics are what people see, and what people see is the headmaster's daughter spending a lot of private time with the guy everyone's decided is trouble."

I stopped walking. "Do you think I'm making a mistake? Being friends with Noah?"

Meredith considered the question seriously. "No. I think Noah is good for you. You're more yourself around him. But I also think you need to be realistic about the cost of that friendship given your position here."

"I'm tired of calculating costs for every decision."

"I know. But ignoring costs doesn't make them disappear."

She was right, frustratingly. But I also wasn't willing to end a friendship that felt genuine just because maintaining it required navigating social politics.

Thursday afternoon, Noah and I met at Lakeside Point. October was turning colder, the leaves nearly all fallen, but the spot remained our sanctuary.

We talked about everything and nothing—classes, college applications, books we were reading, music we'd discovered. Noah told me about his strained phone call with his parents the night before, their disappointment thinly veiled by politeness. I shared my stress about college essays trying to present myself as interesting while maintaining appropriate perfection.

"You know what's messed up?" Noah said, skipping a stone across the river. "We're both so busy managing how we appear to everyone else that we barely know who we actually are underneath."

"Speak for yourself. I know exactly who I am—I'm the perfectionist daughter of a widowed headmaster who's spent five years avoiding any authentic expression of emotion or desire."

"Okay, so you know who you've been performing. But who would you be if you stopped performing?"

The question hit hard. "I honestly don't know."

"Me neither. That's the messed up part."

We sat in comfortable silence, watching the river move past. This friendship, these conversations—they felt like the beginning of figuring out the answer.

"Can I ask you something personal?" Noah said.

"You can always ask. Whether I'll answer is different."

"Do you have feelings for me? Like, beyond friendship?"

My heart jumped. I'd been carefully not examining that question, storing it in the mental box labeled 'complicated emotions to avoid.'

"Why are you asking?"

"Because Sloane cornered me after class yesterday and asked if we were dating. And when I said no, she implied that you're into me but I'm too oblivious to notice. Which made me realize I should probably just ask instead of guessing."

I wanted to deflect, make a joke, redirect the conversation. But Noah and I had built our friendship on honesty, and lying now would undermine that.

"I don't know," I said slowly. "I like spending time with you. I think about our conversations when we're apart. I look forward to seeing you. But I don't know if that's romantic feelings or just finally having a real friendship. Everything's so tangled up with all the other complications—the school politics, my father's concerns, everyone watching and judging. I can't separate what I actually feel from what I think I'm supposed to feel or not supposed to feel."

Noah nodded, taking this in. "That's fair. And honest. Thank you."

"What about you? Do you have feelings for me?"

"I like you. I like talking to you, being honest with you, feeling like someone actually sees me instead of my reputation. But I also know I'm on probation, under scrutiny, one mistake from expulsion. Getting romantically involved with the headmaster's daughter would be complicated in ways I don't know if either of us is ready for."

"So we're friends who like each other but are too smart to act on it because the timing and context are terrible?"

"Something like that."

It should have been disappointing. Instead, it felt like clarity. We both knew there was something between us, but we also both understood that navigating it required more than just feelings. Timing mattered. Context mattered. Not being expelled mattered.

"I can live with that," I said.

"Me too. For now."

Walking back to campus as evening settled in, I realized I was okay with undefined. For seventeen years, I'd needed everything clearly categorized, properly labeled, socially acceptable. But maybe some things could just exist without needing immediate definition.

Noah was my friend. Maybe someday more, maybe not. For now, that was enough.
