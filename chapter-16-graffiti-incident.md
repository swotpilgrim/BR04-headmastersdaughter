# Chapter 16: Graffiti Incident

Monday morning arrived with crisp late October cold that made the walk from South Hall almost painful. I pulled my cardigan tighter and hurried across the quad with Meredith, trying not to slip on the frost-slick brick walkways.

That's when I noticed the crowd near the gymnasium entrance, students pressed together in that particular way that suggested something shocking. Their voices carried across the quad—exclamations, gasps, scandal.

"What's going on?" Meredith asked, already changing direction toward the gathering.

I followed, my stomach tightening. Whatever had happened, I'd be expected to know about it, to have an opinion, to represent my father's position.

We pushed through the outer ring and I saw it.

The gymnasium's brick exterior wall, usually pristine and formal, was covered in spray-painted graffiti. Crude images mocked Riverside's seal and traditions—the school crest drawn with exaggerated, distorted features, words scrawled in angry red paint that ridiculed formal dinners and dress codes. Phrases like "Down with Dead Traditions" and "Free Thinking Zone" sprawled across ten feet of wall space, impossible to miss, impossible to ignore.

"Oh my God," Meredith breathed.

The crowd kept growing. This kind of vandalism didn't happen at Riverside. We had small pranks occasionally, but nothing like this. This was deliberate destruction that got students expelled.

"Who would do this?" someone asked, their voice carrying over the general murmur.

"Are you kidding?" another voice answered. "It's obvious. The transfer kid. What's his name—Bennett?"

My chest constricted.

"He got kicked out of his last school for vandalism," a senior girl said confidently. "This is exactly his kind of thing."

"I heard his friends visited this weekend," someone else added. "They were total troublemakers."

The assumptions were immediate, certain, damning. I wanted to argue but had no evidence, no proof. Just a conviction that he wouldn't do this, not after working so hard to stay out of trouble.

"Students, step back." Dean Patterson pushed forward with maintenance staff, his expression rigid with fury. "Everyone to first period. Now."

The crowd dispersed reluctantly. Meredith tugged my arm but I looked back once and saw Dean Patterson examining the wall, his jaw tight.

This was very bad.

First period passed in a blur of whispered conversations. By the time the bell rang, everyone had a theory and most centered on Noah.

His usual seat in calculus sat empty.

"Where's Bennett?" someone asked the teacher.

"He's been called to the administration office," she replied curtly, in a tone that suggested no further questions would be welcome.

My stomach dropped. Called to the office already, before any real investigation.

Between periods, I caught Tyler in the hallway, his expression furious.

"This is garbage," he said. "They pulled Noah out of first period like he was already convicted."

"Do you know where Noah is now?" I asked quietly.

Tyler shook his head. "No idea. But he didn't do it, Kelsey. He was with me Sunday night after the basketball game. We watched a movie in the common room with six other guys. He wouldn't risk his probation for something this stupid."

I believed him. But belief wasn't evidence.

"I know," I said softly. "But I don't know how to help him."

Tyler's expression hardened. "Neither do I. And that's what they're counting on."

By lunch, the dining hall had transformed into a courtroom of public opinion. Every table buzzed with the same topic, and the verdict was uniform.

"I can't believe he'd be that stupid," one council member said, shaking his head. "He had to know he'd get caught."

"Maybe he wanted to get caught," another suggested. "Some people sabotage themselves."

I pushed food around my plate, my appetite gone.

Three tables over, Sloane Whitmore held court with her usual audience. Her voice carried deliberately across the dining hall. "I'm not surprised at all. Noah always had this self-destructive streak. At our old school, he couldn't help himself—had to make these grand gestures against authority. I tried to warn people when I transferred here, but no one wanted to listen."

Meredith's hand found mine under the table, squeezing once. Warning me not to react.

But then Tyler stood up at his table, his chair scraping loudly against the floor. "You don't know what you're talking about, Sloane. Noah didn't do this."

The dining hall quieted, dozens of conversations pausing to watch.

"Really?" Sloane turned toward him with false sweetness. "And you know this how?"

"Because he was with me Sunday night. Because he's been working his ass off to stay out of trouble. Because maybe not everyone is as shallow and vindictive as you are."

Sloane's face flushed red. "At least I'm not defending vandals."

"At least I'm not condemning people before knowing the facts."

"Mr. Bradford, Miss Whitmore, that's enough." One of the faculty supervisors stood up from the monitoring table. "Both of you sit down and finish your lunch quietly."

Tyler sat, his jaw clenched. Sloane turned back to her friends with a smug expression that made my chest burn.

"Tyler has a point though," Meredith said carefully. "We don't actually know who did it."

"Come on." The senior boy across from us shook his head. "Bennett got kicked out of his last school for vandalism. His friends showed up this weekend and tried to sneak alcohol onto campus. The guy's on academic probation. Who else would it be?"

I wanted to argue. I wanted to defend Noah the way Tyler had. But I sat there silent, frozen by the weight of my position. If I spoke up now, it would be seen as the headmaster's daughter showing favoritism, letting personal feelings cloud judgment. It would hurt Noah more than help him.

The cowardice of my silence tasted bitter.

After lunch, my route took me past the administration building. I saw my father's office door slightly ajar and heard voices inside.

I paused just outside the doorway, out of sight but within earshot.

"—no choice here, Richard." Dean Patterson's voice was firm, absolute. "The boy is on academic probation with a zero-tolerance policy. Vandalism was the exact offense that got him expelled from his previous school. This is a pattern of behavior."

"I understand, Marcus, but we need evidence beyond circumstantial—"

"What more evidence do you need? His visiting friends demonstrated the same disrespect. He has motive, opportunity—he was seen near the gymnasium Sunday evening by multiple witnesses—and history. This is exactly who Noah Bennett is."

"We don't know that for certain."

"With respect, you're letting compassion cloud your judgment. If this were any other student, you'd move swiftly. But because your daughter has taken an interest in him—"

"That's enough." My father's voice sharpened. "My daughter's friendships have nothing to do with how I handle disciplinary matters."

A heavy pause.

"I hope you're right about that," Patterson said quietly. "Because the board will be watching how you handle this. If we don't take decisive action, it sends a message that Riverside's standards mean nothing."

"I'm aware of the politics, Marcus. Schedule an emergency disciplinary hearing for Wednesday morning. That gives us time to interview witnesses and gather complete information. We'll make our determination then based on evidence."

"Wednesday?" Patterson sounded unhappy. "That's two days away. Bennett should be suspended immediately pending—"

"He'll be confined to his dormitory except for supervised activities. Wednesday morning, we'll hold the hearing. That's my decision."

I heard movement and quickly walked away. Wednesday morning. Two days before a hearing that sounded predetermined.

Dinner that evening felt surreal. The atmosphere was charged with gossip. Noah's empty seat at Tyler's table was conspicuous.

I couldn't eat. Halfway through the meal, my father stood and the dining hall quieted.

"I want to address the incident that occurred this morning," he began. "The vandalism is being investigated thoroughly. We will hold a disciplinary hearing Wednesday morning to determine appropriate consequences. Until then, I expect all students to refrain from speculation. If anyone has information, please come forward."

It was measured and appropriate. But I heard what wasn't said—no mention of Noah by name, though everyone knew. No declaration of innocence. The careful language of an administrator protecting the institution.

I pushed back my chair. "Excuse me. I'm not feeling well."

Meredith gave me a concerned look but didn't stop me. The moment I was outside, the panic hit fully.

Noah was going to be expelled. His probation status meant no margin for error, no benefit of the doubt. The institution needed swift punishment to demonstrate Riverside's standards.

And I had said nothing. Done nothing.

I walked toward the headmaster's residence, arms wrapped around myself. The lights were on inside—warm, safe. My home where I'd always been protected, always been given every advantage.

Noah had no protection. Just a reputation that condemned him.

Standing outside in the dark, I realized I had to choose. Stay safe and silent, maintaining my perfect position. Or fight for what I knew was right, even if it meant risking everything.

The choice should have been easy. But I felt paralyzed by fear.

I had two days to find my courage.

Two days to save someone who deserved better than what Riverside was prepared to give him.
