# Chapter 15: Visiting Friends

The weekend arrived unseasonably warm for October. Noah's friends from Choate were visiting—Jake and Connor, two seniors he'd been close with before the expulsion.

I first saw them Saturday afternoon in the quad. They stood out immediately—louder than Riverside students, more casually dressed, with prep school confidence that came from old money and elite institutions. They were laughing, voices carrying across the lawn where I sat with Meredith studying.

Noah was with them, and seeing him next to his old friends created dissonance. He seemed both relaxed and guarded, code-switching between his Riverside self and whoever he'd been at Choate.

"Those must be the visiting friends," Meredith observed, following my gaze.

"Must be."

"They look... chaotic."

She wasn't wrong. Where Riverside students moved with careful awareness of social hierarchies and appropriate behavior, these two moved like they owned whatever space they occupied.

At dinner, the difference became pronounced. Noah sat with Jake and Connor at his usual table. The conversation was louder, jokes edgier, energy different. Faculty members watched with obvious concern.

Jake was telling a story about a Choate party involving the headmaster's lawn. Connor added embellishments making it more outrageous.

I caught fragments from the student council table.

"...can't believe they expelled you..."

"...totally worth it..."

"...Riverside is so uptight..."

Noah was laughing, participating, but I saw the tension in his shoulders. He was performing carefree rebel while actually aware of Dean Patterson watching from the faculty table.

After dinner, I saw Noah's friends attempting to leave campus. Security stopped them at the gate, checking bags.

From near the library, I watched security find bottles in Connor's backpack. Alcohol.

Dean Patterson materialized, summoning Noah. My stomach dropped.

I wanted to help, but interference would make things worse. I stood uselessly while my father joined Patterson and security, while Noah's face went carefully blank—protecting himself—while his friends tried to talk their way out.

Eventually, Noah's friends were escorted off campus. Not expelled—they were visitors, not students—but banned from returning. Noah was taken to the administration building, presumably for questioning and potential disciplinary action.

I texted him: *What can I do?*

No response.

An hour later, sitting in my dorm room pretending to study, my father called.

"Kelsey, I need you to understand what happened tonight."

My heart sank. "I saw some of it."

"Noah Bennett's friends attempted to bring alcohol onto campus. Mr. Bennett signed them in as guests, which makes him responsible for their behavior. They claimed he didn't know about the alcohol, and I believe that's likely true. However, the association and judgment involved in hosting guests who would so blatantly violate school policy raises serious questions."

"Dad—"

"Let me finish. Dean Patterson is arguing for immediate probation violation and expulsion. I've convinced him to conduct a full investigation first, get statements from Mr. Bennett and his friends. But Kelsey, this doesn't look good. Even if Noah didn't know about the alcohol, he chose to host visitors who showed poor judgment throughout their time here."

"They're not him. He's been following every rule, maintaining excellent grades, participating appropriately. Punishing him for his friends' choices isn't fair."

"Life isn't always fair. Associations matter. Judgment matters. I'm giving him the benefit of investigation before any decisions, but I need you to understand that the outcome may not be what you hope."

After he hung up, I sat staring at my phone. This was exactly what Noah had feared—that his past would catch up with him, that one association or perceived mistake would trigger his expulsion despite months of appropriate behavior.

I texted Meredith: *Can you come to my room?*

She arrived within minutes. "I heard. Tyler called me. He's with Noah now."

"What's happening?"

"Patterson interrogated Noah for an hour. Your dad was there too, asking questions but being more reasonable than Patterson. Noah swears he had no idea about the alcohol, that his friends promised they wouldn't bring anything inappropriate. Tyler believes him."

"I believe him too."

"I know you do. But belief and proof aren't the same thing, and Patterson's been looking for a reason to expel Noah since September."

I grabbed my jacket. "I need to see him."

"Kelsey, he's confined to his dorm. Visitors aren't allowed right now."

"I don't care. I need him to know I believe him."

Meredith grabbed my arm. "Think about this. If you go to his dorm right now, while he's being investigated, that's going to look like the headmaster's daughter trying to interfere. It'll make things worse for both of you."

She was right, but I hated it. I hated that the right choice was staying away, letting the process happen, trusting that truth would matter more than perception.

My phone finally buzzed. Noah: *I'm okay. Don't do anything. Let the investigation happen. I'll be fine.*

I wanted to believe that. But I'd watched too many times as Riverside prioritized reputation over fairness, appearances over actual justice.

Sunday was excruciating. Noah remained confined to North Hall while Dean Patterson conducted interviews. I tried to focus on homework, on college applications, on anything other than imagining Noah being expelled for his friends' mistakes.

Meredith kept me updated through Tyler. Noah had maintained his story—he'd invited old friends to visit, they'd promised to follow all rules, he had no knowledge of alcohol being brought onto campus. Jake and Connor, reached by phone, had confirmed Noah's account and apologized for jeopardizing his standing.

Monday morning, I learned the decision.

Mr. Webb pulled me aside before English class. "I wanted you to hear this from me rather than through gossip. Noah's investigation concluded. He's been cleared of knowledge about the alcohol. However, he's been formally reprimanded for poor judgment in guest selection and given a final warning. One more incident of any kind—even peripherally related to him—and he'll be expelled automatically."

"But he didn't do anything wrong."

"He exercised poor judgment in maintaining friendships with students whose values don't align with Riverside's expectations. That's the official determination."

So Noah would stay, but under even more scrutiny, with even less margin for error. It was better than expulsion but still fundamentally unfair.

"There's more," Mr. Webb said gently. "Dean Patterson has recommended that your partnership with Noah be reassigned for future projects. He believes the association is inappropriate given the circumstances."

"You're not going to do that."

"I'm considering all perspectives." He paused. "But I'm also aware that punishing academic excellence because of administrative politics would be equally inappropriate. No immediate changes to existing partnerships."

After class, I finally saw Noah in the hallway. He looked exhausted, the weekend having taken visible toll.

"Can we talk?" I asked quietly.

"Not here. Too many eyes."

We met at Lakeside Point an hour later, skipping lunch to have privacy.

"I'm sorry," were his first words.

"You have nothing to apologize for."

"I brought people onto campus who violated rules and almost got expelled because of it. That's definitely something to apologize for."

"You trusted friends who let you down. That's not the same as making a mistake."

Noah sat heavily on his usual rock. "Jake and Connor were my best friends at Choate. We did everything together. After the expulsion, they were the only ones who still talked to me, who didn't write me off as the screw-up. I wanted to show them Riverside, share this part of my life now. I didn't expect them to sabotage it."

"Did they know about your probation? The consequences if anything went wrong?"

"Yeah, I told them. They promised to be on best behavior." He laughed bitterly. "Guess their best behavior isn't very good."

I sat next to him, close enough our shoulders touched. "What did they say when Patterson called them?"

"That they were sorry, that they didn't think about how it would affect me, that they assumed campus security wouldn't actually check bags." He shook his head. "They're still in the Choate mindset where rules are suggestions and connections protect you from real consequences. They don't get that I don't have that safety net anymore."

"Are you still friends with them?"

"I don't know. I thought we were, but friends don't put you at risk like that, even unintentionally. Maybe we've grown in different directions and I didn't want to see it."

We sat in silence, watching the river. The weekend had been a harsh reminder that Noah's probation status wasn't just administrative technicality—it was real constraint with real stakes.

"I wanted to come see you Saturday night," I admitted. "Meredith stopped me. Said it would make things worse."

"She was right. Patterson was already suspicious that you'd try to interfere."

"I hate this. I hate that you're living under constant threat of expulsion for things that aren't your fault."

"That's the deal I accepted coming here. One mistake, any mistake, and I'm done."

"It's not fair."

"No. But it's reality." Noah looked at me. "Which is why we need to talk about Fall Formal."

My stomach tightened. "What about it?"

"This weekend proved that my presence complicates your life in ways that aren't sustainable. If we go to Fall Formal together, you'll be publicly associated with me. When something else goes wrong—and given my track record, something will—you'll be caught in the fallout."

"Noah—"

"I'm trying to protect you from being collateral damage in my disaster of a senior year."

"I don't want protection. I want to make my own choices."

"Even when those choices might hurt you?"

I took his hand, forcing him to face me. "The only thing that would hurt me is you making decisions for me because you've decided I can't handle the complexity. I know what I'm signing up for. I want to go to Fall Formal with you. That hasn't changed."

"You're sure?"

"I'm sure. Let Riverside judge. Let Patterson disapprove. Let my father have concerns. I'm going to the formal with you because I want to, and I'm done letting fear of consequences control my choices."

Noah squeezed my hand. "Okay. Then we're going together."

"Together."

Walking back to campus, I felt steadier than I had all weekend. The visit from Noah's friends had been a crisis, but it had also clarified something. I wasn't choosing Noah despite complications—I was choosing him knowing the complications, accepting them as part of the reality we were navigating.

That was its own kind of honesty.

And maybe that was all anyone could really ask for.
