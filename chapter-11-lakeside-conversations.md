# Chapter 11: Lakeside Conversations

Saturday afternoon, I needed to escape. The week had been intense—the presentation, continued gossip, constant awareness of being watched and judged. I grabbed a book and headed to Lakeside Point, the one place on campus where I could actually breathe without performing.

The October air was crisp, leaves turning brilliant reds and golds, the river reflecting autumn colors. I settled on one of the flat rocks near the water, pulled my cardigan tighter against the chill, and opened my book. For the first time in days, I felt my shoulders relax.

I'd read maybe three pages when I heard footsteps on the path.

Noah emerged from the trees, looking as surprised to see me as I was to see him.

"Hey," he said. "Didn't expect company."

"Neither did I. But the unspoken rule is that if someone's here alone, you leave them alone, remember?"

He started to turn back. "I can go—"

"Stay." The word came out before I'd thought about it. "I mean, if you want. I don't mind sharing the space."

Noah settled on a nearby rock, far enough to give me space but close enough for conversation if we wanted it. He didn't pull out a book or his phone—just sat watching the river move past, comfortable in silence.

We sat quietly for several minutes. It should have been awkward, but it wasn't. There was something peaceful about sharing space without needing to fill it with words or performance.

"Can I ask you something?" Noah said eventually.

"You always can."

"Do you ever just do things for yourself? Not for your father, not for student council, not to maintain your perfect record. Just because you want to?"

I thought about it honestly. "I'm here, aren't I?"

"Are you? Or are you here because it's the designated escape spot and coming here is still part of the acceptable script for dealing with stress?"

The question hit harder than I expected. Was I? Even my rebellion, my moments of claimed freedom, were they just following a different set of rules?

"I don't know," I admitted. "I've been following scripts for so long I'm not sure I know what wanting something outside the script would even feel like."

"That's kind of sad."

"Yeah. It is." I closed my book, accepting I wasn't actually going to read. "What about you? You said you came to Riverside expecting to fail. Has that changed?"

Noah picked up a smooth stone and turned it over in his hands. "Some. I'm not actively trying to fail anymore, which is progress. The presentation going well this week helped. Mr. Webb believing our work was competition-worthy helped."

"But?"

"But I still don't really belong here. I'm not one of the legacy students who've been groomed for places like this since birth. I'm not even one of the scholarship students who earned their way in through merit. I'm the bought-and-paid-for second chance whose parents wrote checks to make my problems disappear."

"You earned your place here through the work you're doing now," I said. "The presentation was good because you're smart and thoughtful and you actually care about ideas instead of just grades."

"Maybe. Or maybe I'm just good at performing intellectualism while being fundamentally unfit for institutional life."

I shifted on my rock to face him more directly. "Do you actually believe that? Or is that just the story you tell yourself to stay defended?"

Noah looked at me, startled. "What do you mean?"

"I mean, I perform perfection to avoid judgment. You perform defiance to avoid vulnerability. We're both hiding, just in opposite directions."

He was quiet, considering. "That's... probably fair."

"So what do you actually want? If you weren't performing the troubled bad boy who doesn't fit in, what would you want from being here?"

Noah threw the stone into the river, watching ripples spread. "Honestly? I'd want what we had this week. Working with someone who challenges me intellectually. Having a teacher who believes in my work. Feeling like I'm actually learning and thinking instead of just checking boxes. Maybe a couple of genuine friendships with people who see me instead of my record."

"You have that with Tyler."

"Yeah, I do. Tyler's good people." Noah smiled slightly. "And with you, I think. Unless that's presumptuous."

"Not presumptuous. I consider you a friend. Maybe my most honest friend, which is weird since we've only known each other a few weeks."

"Sometimes the most honest relationships happen fast. No time to build up defensive layers."

We sat with that for a moment. The afternoon was beautiful—golden light, cool air, the sound of water moving over rocks. This moment felt real in a way so much of my life didn't.

"Can I tell you something I've never told anyone?" I asked.

"Of course."

"Sometimes I resent my mother for dying."

Noah didn't react with shock or judgment, just listened.

"Not for dying exactly," I continued, needing to explain. "But for leaving me alone with all the responsibility of keeping my father functional and representing the school perfectly and being the good daughter who never causes problems. I was twelve. I should have been allowed to grieve messily, to need things, to be imperfect. Instead, I had to be the strong one."

"That's a lot to carry."

"It is. And I feel guilty for resenting it because she didn't choose to get cancer, didn't choose to leave us. But I'm also angry that I lost my childhood to grief management and reputation maintenance."

"You're allowed to feel both things," Noah said gently. "Love and resentment, grief and anger. They're not mutually exclusive."

"My father would be devastated if he knew I felt this way."

"Maybe. Or maybe he'd be relieved that you're finally being honest instead of perfect."

I wanted to believe that. I wasn't sure I could.

"What about you?" I asked. "What haven't you told anyone?"

Noah was quiet for a long moment, staring at the river. When he spoke, his voice was softer than usual.

"The statue incident at Choate? I did it the night after my parents told me they were embarrassed by me. Not disappointed—embarrassed. Like my existence reflected badly on them."

"Noah..."

"They'd just had this donor dinner where someone asked about me, and I'd recently written an op-ed in the school paper about income inequality. Apparently, that was inappropriate for someone from our family. So they sat me down and explained that my behavior was embarrassing, that I needed to learn when to keep quiet, that not everything requires my opinion or action."

He picked up another stone, rolling it between his palms.

"And I just... broke. I was so tired of being told that principles were embarrassing, that caring about things was inappropriate, that the correct response to injustice was polite silence. So I spray-painted that statue knowing it would humiliate them. Not because it was the most effective activism, but because I wanted them to feel what they'd made me feel."

"That's incredibly human," I said.

"It's incredibly petty. I torpedoed my own future to make a point to my parents."

"No, you made a choice to prioritize your integrity over their comfort. That's different."

Noah looked at me. "You really believe that?"

"I do. Your parents wanted you to be someone you're not. They were asking you to compromise your values for their social convenience. You refused. That took courage, even if the execution was messy."

"Thank you," he said quietly. "For seeing it that way. My parents definitely don't."

"Do they ever visit? Or call?"

"Mandatory weekly check-in calls where they ask about grades and remind me not to screw up again. No visits planned. I think they're still too embarrassed."

We sat in comfortable silence again. The sun was starting to angle lower, afternoon shifting toward evening.

"This is nice," Noah said. "Just talking. No agenda, no performance, no one watching."

"It really is. I feel more like myself here than anywhere else on campus."

"Even more than with Meredith?"

I considered. "Meredith sees me as I am, which is amazing. But even with her, I'm still somewhat managed. I don't want to burden her with everything. But here, with you, I don't feel like I have to manage anything."

"Same. You don't expect me to be either the perfect reformed student or the rebellious troublemaker. I can just be... me. Whoever that is."

"That's exactly it."

The evening chill was setting in, October reminding us that winter wasn't far away. We should probably head back to campus for dinner. But neither of us moved.

"I don't want to go back yet," I admitted.

"Neither do I. But if we miss formal dinner, people will notice."

"People always notice."

"Yeah, but do you care?"

I thought about it. A month ago, the answer would have been an automatic yes. Now? "Less than I used to."

"Progress."

We stood, brushing off our jeans, gathering our things. Walking back through the trees toward campus, I felt lighter. This conversation, this honesty, this friendship—it was real in a way most of my life wasn't.

"Same time next Saturday?" Noah asked as we approached the edge of campus.

"If the weather holds. And if we both need escape."

"We'll probably both need escape. Riverside doesn't exactly foster peace and quiet."

"True. Then yes. Same time, same place."

We separated before reaching the dining hall—no need to arrive together and invite more commentary. But as I walked toward South Hall to change for dinner, I realized I was smiling.

Real friendship. Honest conversation. Space to be imperfect.

Maybe this was what living for myself instead of performing for others could feel like.

And maybe that was worth all the gossip and judgment Riverside wanted to throw at me.
