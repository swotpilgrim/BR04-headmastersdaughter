# Chapter 9: Social Pressure

By Friday, the entire school seemed to know that Kelsey Morrison and Noah Bennett were spending significant time together. The gossip had evolved from "debate partners" to something more speculative, more judgmental. I felt it in the dining hall, in hallways between classes, in the way conversations paused when I walked past.

Sloane had been busy.

I arrived at lunch Friday to find Meredith already at our table, looking tense.

"Heads up," she said quietly as I sat. "It's been a morning."

"Define 'it's been a morning.'"

"Sloane spent breakfast telling anyone who would listen about how you're 'playing with fire' by spending so much time with Noah. She's painting herself as the concerned friend who knows him from Choate and is just worried about you getting hurt."

I set down my water glass too hard. "She's not my friend. And she doesn't know me."

"I know that. You know that. But she's convincing, and people love drama involving the headmaster's daughter."

Around the dining hall, I could feel eyes on me. Students at nearby tables watching with poorly concealed interest. This was entertainment for them—the perfect girl showing cracks, associating with the problematic transfer student.

Marcus Chen approached our table. "Kelsey, student council meeting got moved to right after lunch. President wants to discuss Fall Formal logistics."

"Got it. Thanks."

He hesitated. "Also, I don't know if this is my place, but there's been talk. About you and Bennett. Just... be careful, okay? People are watching."

People were always watching. That was my entire life.

"I appreciate the concern," I said neutrally.

After he left, Meredith shook her head. "This is ridiculous. You're working on a class project. Even if you weren't, it's nobody's business."

"Welcome to being the headmaster's daughter."

Sloane herself arrived at the dining hall with her usual entourage, taking a table positioned perfectly to observe mine. She caught my eye and smiled—friendly on the surface, triumphant underneath.

I looked away first, hating myself for it.

In the serving line, I overheard two junior girls talking.

"...wouldn't think the headmaster's daughter would go for someone like that..."

"...heard he got expelled for vandalism..."

"...probably thinks she can fix him..."

I collected my food mechanically, face neutral, refusing to react. But internally, fury simmered. They didn't know Noah. Didn't know his actual story, his principles, his thoughtfulness. They just accepted the easy narrative about the troubled bad boy because it was simpler than questioning their assumptions.

Back at the table, Meredith was glaring at the junior girls. "I could say something."

"Don't. It'll just feed the gossip."

"So you're just going to let them trash-talk both of you?"

"What's the alternative? Publicly defend him and confirm that I care what they think? Then I'm the headmaster's daughter who can't take criticism, or worse, the girl with a crush defending her bad boy project."

"You shouldn't have to choose between defending someone and protecting yourself."

"But I do. That's been my entire life." Meredith stabbed at her salad. "I hate that you have to calculate every response. It's exhausting just watching you do it."

"Imagine living it," I said quietly.

The student council meeting after lunch was painful. We discussed Fall Formal decorations, budget allocation, ticket prices. Normal business. But I felt the subtext in every interaction—the careful way people spoke to me, the meaningful glances exchanged when they thought I wasn't looking.

Sarah Williams pulled me aside as we were leaving. "Kelsey, I want to ask you something, and I'm asking as a friend."

We weren't really friends, but I nodded.

"Is there something going on with you and Noah Bennett?"

"We're debate partners. We meet to work on our project."

"Just the project?"

I met her eyes directly. "Is there a reason student council needs to know details about my academic partnerships?"

She had the grace to look embarrassed. "No, of course not. I just... people are talking. I wanted to make sure you knew."

"I know. Thanks for the concern."

Walking back to the dorm to drop off my bag before afternoon classes, I passed Dean Patterson in the hallway. He slowed, clearly intending to speak to me.

"Miss Morrison. A word?"

My stomach sank. "Yes, Dean Patterson?"

"I've been hearing... observations. About your association with Mr. Bennett." His tone was formal, carefully neutral. "I want to be clear that there's nothing inappropriate about academic partnerships. However, I'd hate to see your excellent record and reputation complicated by proximity to a student on disciplinary probation."

"Noah hasn't violated any rules since arriving at Riverside," I said carefully. "He's maintained excellent academic standing and participated respectfully in class. Mr. Webb speaks highly of his work."

"Academic performance and character judgment are different matters." Patterson's expression was stern. "His history at Choate demonstrates a willingness to prioritize personal ideology over institutional loyalty. That's concerning."

"Or it demonstrates principles," I countered, then immediately regretted it. Arguing with Dean Patterson wasn't strategic.

His eyes narrowed slightly. "I see. Well, Miss Morrison, I trust you'll make wise choices. Your father has worked hard to maintain Riverside's standards. It would be unfortunate if his daughter's associations complicated that legacy."

The implicit threat was clear. "I appreciate your concern," I said, using the same neutral phrase I'd deployed three times already today. "I should get to class."

He nodded, dismissing me with clear disapproval.

In English class, Mr. Webb announced that debate presentations would begin next week. Kelsey and Noah were scheduled for Wednesday. He praised several partnerships for their preliminary research, including ours.

After class, Noah caught up with me in the hallway.

"Hey, can we meet this weekend to finalize the presentation? Maybe Sunday afternoon?"

I glanced around, acutely aware of students nearby. Sloane was three lockers down, pretending not to listen but obviously eavesdropping.

"Library Sunday at two?" I said quietly.

"Perfect. See you then."

As he walked away, Sloane materialized at my elbow.

"You know, Kelsey, I really think we should talk. Girl to girl."

I closed my locker. "About what?"

"About Noah. I knew him at Choate, and I'd hate to see you get hurt."

"I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine."

"Are you? Because from where I'm standing, you're risking your reputation for someone who destroys everything he touches." Her voice was sweet, concerned. "He got expelled. He embarrassed his family. He'll do the same here eventually, and if you're too close, you'll get caught in the fallout."

"Noah made a principled choice that the administration at Choate didn't want to deal with," I said evenly. "That's not the same as being destructive."

"Is that what he told you? That it was principled?" Sloane laughed lightly. "Kelsey, he spray-painted a statue during a donor event. That's vandalism, not activism. And the fact that he's convinced you otherwise just proves how manipulative he can be."

My jaw tightened. "Thanks for your perspective."

I walked away before she could say more, but her words echoed. Was I being naive? Had Noah manipulated me into seeing him as wrongly judged instead of genuinely problematic?

No. I'd seen his actual character. His thoughtfulness, his intelligence, his genuine principles. Sloane was the manipulative one, trying to plant doubt.

But walking back to my dorm, I felt the weight of judgment from every direction. The school watching, gossiping, analyzing my choices. My father's concern. Dean Patterson's warning. Sloane's calculated undermining.

Meredith was in our room, working on homework.

"You look like you've had a day," she observed.

"Dean Patterson stopped me. Warned me about 'proximity' to students on probation affecting my reputation."

"Are you kidding?"

"I wish I were." I dropped my bag and sat heavily on my bed. "Meredith, am I being stupid? Is everyone right that I should just focus on my own stuff and stop spending time with Noah?"

"Do you want my honest answer?"

"Always."

"I think Noah is the first person you've connected with who sees you as Kelsey instead of as the headmaster's daughter or the perfect student or whatever role everyone else needs you to play. I think you're happier when you're with him. And I think everyone pushing back has more to do with maintaining social order than with any actual concern for your wellbeing."

"So you think I should ignore everyone?"

"I think you should listen to yourself for once instead of calculating what everyone else wants you to do."

I lay back on my bed, staring at the ceiling. Listening to myself. What did I actually want?

I wanted to work on the debate project with Noah. I wanted our honest conversations. I wanted to stop performing perfection every single minute. I wanted to spend time with someone who challenged me intellectually and accepted me as I actually was.

And I was tired of letting other people's judgments control my choices.

My phone buzzed. Text from Noah: *Heard today was rough. Hope you're okay. See you Sunday.*

I stared at the message. He'd heard. Of course he'd heard—the gossip affected him too.

I typed back: *I'm fine. Looking forward to Sunday.*

His response was immediate: *Same.*

Meredith looked up from her homework. "Was that him?"

"Yeah."

"And?"

"And I'm going to keep working with him. Let people talk."

"Good." Meredith smiled. "About time you stopped letting everyone else write your story."

That night at dinner, I sat with the student council as usual. Sloane was at her table, holding court. People whispered and watched. But when I spotted Noah across the dining hall sitting with Tyler, and he gave me a small nod of acknowledgment, I nodded back.

Publicly. Deliberately.

Let them watch.

I was done apologizing for making my own choices.
