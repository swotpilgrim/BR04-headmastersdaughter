# Chapter 20: Pieces Come Together

I spotted them immediately. East side of the dining hall, just like Tyler said. Three junior boys at a corner table, laughing over their breakfast trays.

Marcus Washington. Jake Porter. Sam Turner.

They looked relaxed, carefree. Like they didn't have a care in the world while Noah was about to face expulsion for something he didn't do.

Meredith touched my arm. "Kelsey. Are you sure about this?"

"No," I admitted. "But I'm out of options."

I grabbed my tray and walked directly to their table. All three looked up in surprise when I set my tray down across from them.

"Hi," I said, keeping my voice friendly but firm. "I'm Kelsey Morrison. We need to talk about the graffiti."

The effect was immediate. Marcus's easy smile faltered. Jake's face went pale. Sam looked down at his eggs like they were suddenly fascinating.

"Why would we know anything about that?" Marcus said, trying to sound casual. But his voice was defensive, guarded.

"Because you were bragging about it Monday morning in the locker room. Tyler heard you. 'Bet the administration didn't see that coming.' 'Traditions aren't so sacred now, are they?' Sound familiar?"

The three boys exchanged quick glances. The kind of look that screams guilt.

"We weren't bragging," Marcus said. "We were just commenting on how crazy everyone was acting. It's not our fault the whole school lost their minds over some graffiti."

"Really." I leaned forward, using every ounce of authority that came with being the headmaster's daughter. "Because from where I'm sitting, you three look terrified. And guilty. So let's try this again. What do you know about the vandalism?"

"Nothing," Jake said quickly. Too quickly. "We don't know anything."

I focused on Sam, who looked the most uncomfortable. His hands were shaking slightly as he picked at his toast.

"Sam, a student is facing expulsion for something he didn't do. The hearing starts in less than ninety minutes. If you know anything—anything at all—you need to tell the truth now."

"We can't," Sam whispered, not looking up. "We'll get in massive trouble."

"You're already in trouble," I said quietly. "The question is whether you let an innocent person take the fall for what you did."

Marcus stood up abruptly, his chair scraping loudly. "We're not talking about this. Come on, guys."

But Sam grabbed his arm. "Marcus, wait."

"Don't say anything," Marcus hissed.

Sam looked up at me, his eyes miserable. "Will they expel him? Noah Bennett. Will they really expel him?"

"Probably," I said honestly. "Unless someone tells the truth about what actually happened."

"We didn't mean for anyone to get in trouble," Sam said, his voice breaking. "We thought it was just a prank. We didn't think—"

"Sam, shut up!" Marcus's voice was sharp with panic.

But Sam shook his head. "We can't let him get expelled, Marcus. That's not right. That's not what we wanted."

Jake was staring at his plate, looking sick. "He's right. We can't let this happen. It's gone too far."

"We'll get suspended," Marcus said desperately. "Maybe expelled ourselves. Our parents will kill us."

"Better us than someone innocent," Sam said, his voice stronger now. "We did this. We have to own it."

I held my breath, watching the three boys wrestle with their conscience. Finally, Marcus slumped back into his chair, his defiance crumbling into fear and guilt.

"We didn't think it through," he said, his voice barely audible. "It was supposed to be funny. A statement against some of the pretentious traditions here. That's all."

"When did you do it?" I asked, keeping my voice calm and non-judgmental. If they stopped talking now, Noah was done.

"Saturday night," Marcus admitted. "After the basketball game. Security was all focused on the crowd leaving, on making sure students went back to their dorms. We snuck out around seven PM with spray paint we'd checked out from art class earlier that week."

"Saturday?" I repeated. "Not Sunday?"

"Everyone's timeline is wrong," Jake said miserably. "By Sunday night, the graffiti was already there. We just didn't think anyone would check that wall until Monday morning when people arrived for classes."

Sam's hands were shaking. "We didn't mean to frame anyone. We had no idea Noah would get blamed. We barely know who he is. When we heard Monday morning that he was being accused, that he might get expelled..." His voice trailed off.

"You panicked," I finished.

"We freaked out," Marcus corrected. "But we were too scared to come forward. We thought maybe the investigation would prove it wasn't him and we'd get away with it. We didn't mean for it to go this far."

I looked at all three boys. They were my age, maybe a year younger. Terrified, guilty, and realizing too late that actions have consequences. They'd thought they were being clever, making a statement against traditions they found ridiculous. They hadn't thought about who might be blamed. Hadn't considered that their "harmless prank" could destroy someone's future.

"You need to tell my father and Dean Patterson the truth," I said. "Right now. Before the hearing."

"They'll expel us," Jake whispered, his voice breaking.

"Maybe. Probably not, though—voluntary confession counts for something. Coming forward shows character, shows you understand what you did wrong. But even if they do expel you, you'll be telling the truth. Which is what matters."

"Our parents are going to kill us," Sam said miserably.

"Your parents will be disappointed," I agreed. "But they'll be more disappointed if you let an innocent person be punished for your mistake. You made one bad choice. Don't compound it with another one."

"And if we don't come forward?" Marcus asked, though his tone said he already knew the answer.

"Then Noah gets expelled for something he didn't do. And you three live with that for the rest of your lives, knowing you destroyed someone's education, someone's future, to save yourselves from consequences you earned. Is that really who you want to be?"

The three boys looked at each other in silent communication. The weight of the choice was visible on their faces. Finally, Marcus took a deep breath and nodded.

"Okay. We'll tell them. What do we do?"

"Come with me," I said, standing up. "Right now."

Twenty minutes later, I knocked on Mr. Webb's classroom door. He was at his desk grading papers, and looked up in surprise when I entered with three nervous junior boys trailing behind me.

"Kelsey. What's this about?"

"These students have information about the graffiti incident," I said. "Information that needs to be shared with the administration immediately. Before Noah's hearing."

Mr. Webb studied the three boys, his expression shifting from confusion to understanding. He'd been teaching long enough to recognize guilt when he saw it.

"I see." He stood up, closing his grade book. "And you boys want to do the right thing?"

They nodded, looking terrified but resolute.

"Then we need to go to Dr. Morrison's office. Right now." Mr. Webb looked at me. "This is brave of you, Kelsey. And brave of them."

"It's not brave," Marcus said quietly. "It's just what we should have done Monday morning."

---

The walk to the administration building felt surreal. Students passed us in the hallways, heading to early classes, laughing and talking. They had no idea what was about to happen. That everything was about to change.

It was eight forty-five. The hearing was supposed to start at nine.

As we approached my father's office, I could hear voices inside. My stomach dropped.

"The hearing's already started," Mr. Webb said quietly.

Through the closed door, I heard Dean Patterson's voice: "—pattern of behavior that suggests Mr. Bennett has not learned from his previous mistakes. The evidence is circumstantial but compelling."

Noah's voice, quiet and resigned: "I understand. But I didn't do this."

"Saying you didn't do it isn't a defense, Mr. Bennett. We need evidence."

I looked at the three junior boys. "Ready?"

They nodded, though they looked like they might be sick.

I knocked once, then opened the door without waiting for permission.

Everyone turned. My father sat behind his desk, Dean Patterson beside him. Noah sat across from them, looking exhausted and defeated. When he saw me, confusion flickered across his face, followed by something that might have been hope.

"Kelsey," my father said, his voice sharp with surprise and disapproval. "This is a closed hearing. You can't just—"

"These students have something to say," I interrupted, my voice surprisingly steady despite my hammering heart. "Something you need to hear before you continue."

Mr. Webb stepped forward. "Dr. Morrison, Dean Patterson. I believe you should listen to what these young men have to tell you. It's relevant to this proceeding."

My father looked from me to Mr. Webb to the three terrified junior boys. Understanding was beginning to dawn in his expression.

Dean Patterson frowned. "What is this about?"

Marcus stepped forward, his voice shaking. "It's about the graffiti, sir. We need to tell you the truth."

The room went completely silent.

My father gestured to the chairs along the wall. "Everyone sit down."

As the three boys took their seats, I caught Noah's eye. He was staring at me with an expression I couldn't quite read—shock, hope, and something that looked like wonder.

I'd done it. I'd found the truth. Whether it was enough to save him, I didn't know yet.

But at least now the truth would be heard.
