# Chapter 24: Permission to Be Happy

Friday evening after dinner, my father asked me to meet him in his office. The formal request—delivered via his secretary—made my stomach clench with anxiety.

I knocked on his office door at exactly seven PM.

"Come in, Kelsey."

I entered, uncertain whether I was about to be praised or lectured. The week had been such a whirlwind that I honestly didn't know what to expect from this conversation.

"Sit down," he said, his tone impossible to read.

I sat in one of the chairs across from his desk, the same chairs where Noah had sat during his hearing. The memory made my anxiety spike higher.

My father studied me for a long moment. Then he did something unexpected—he moved from behind his desk to sit in the chair beside mine, making the conversation less formal, more personal.

"I asked you here because we need to talk," he began. "About this week. About Noah. About... a lot of things I should have talked to you about years ago."

"Okay," I said carefully.

"I want to apologize to you."

That stopped me cold. "For what?"

"For being so focused on protecting you from scrutiny and maintaining your perfect image that I never stopped to consider whether you're actually happy. Whether the life I've expected you to live is the life you want to live."

I didn't know what to say.

"You've spent five years being incredibly careful," he continued. "The perfect student, the perfect headmaster's daughter. Always appropriate, always mindful of appearances. I thought you were just naturally that way—organized, responsible, cautious. But this week showed me something different."

"What do you mean?"

"You took risks. You confronted students directly. You challenged my judgment. You investigated when it would have been easier and safer to stay quiet. That's not the careful, cautious Kelsey I've known for five years. That's someone with fire and conviction."

"I had to help Noah. He didn't do anything wrong."

"I know. But my question is—why have you been so careful for so long? Why did it take a crisis for you to act on your convictions?"

The question hit too close to uncomfortable truth. I looked down at my hands.

"Because I was scared," I admitted quietly. "Scared of disappointing you. Scared of reflecting badly on your position. After Mom died, you were so overwhelmed with work and grief and trying to hold everything together. I didn't want to add to your burden. So I tried to be perfect. Easy. No problems, no complaints, no trouble."

My father's expression crumbled. "Oh, Kelsey."

"I thought if I was perfect enough, careful enough, you wouldn't have to worry about me. You could focus on the school and everyone would leave us alone. But somewhere along the way I think I lost myself. I stopped knowing what I actually wanted because I was so focused on being what everyone expected."

"That breaks my heart," my father said. "You were thirteen when your mother died. Thirteen. You should have been allowed to grieve and be messy and need support. Instead you became this perfect, careful version of yourself to make my life easier."

"I wanted to help. You were drowning."

"I was. But you were a child. It wasn't your job to manage my grief or make yourself smaller to ease my burden. That was supposed to be my job—to help you through your grief, to make sure you felt safe expressing your feelings. I failed at that."

"I'm so sorry." My father's voice was thick with emotion. "I never meant for you to feel that pressure. Never wanted you to sacrifice yourself for my peace of mind or the school's reputation."

"I know you didn't."

"Your mother would be disappointed in me. She always worried that living on campus, being the headmaster's daughter, would make you feel like you had to be on display all the time. I promised her I'd make sure you had space to just be a kid. To make mistakes and figure out who you are. And then she died, and I was drowning, and I... I didn't keep that promise."

This was the most honest he'd been about Mom's death since the funeral five years ago. Tears pricked my eyes.

"You were doing your best," I said.

"My best wasn't good enough. I let you become so careful, so controlled, that you stopped being fully alive. Until this week, when you finally broke free of those constraints to fight for something—someone—you believed in."

"I had to. I couldn't let Noah be expelled for something he didn't do."

"I know. And I'm grateful you did. Because it showed me what I've been missing—that my daughter has courage and conviction and fire. You're not the perfect, quiet girl everyone assumes. You're fierce when it matters."

I wiped at my eyes, trying not to cry.

"I also want to apologize for my assessment of Noah," my father said. "My initial judgment was biased and unfair. I let his history color my perception instead of seeing him as he actually is. You saw clearly when I didn't."

"You listened when it mattered. You cleared him."

"After you brought me evidence I should have found myself. You investigated more thoroughly than Dean Patterson. You saw past reputation to character." He paused. "Noah is a good young man. Thoughtful, intelligent, working hard to move past a mistake he made two years ago. He's demonstrated integrity and character. I was wrong about him."

"He's more than his worst moment," I said. "That's what I kept trying to tell everyone. People kept defining him by one bad decision he made when he was fifteen. But he's grown since then. He's changed. He deserves a chance to prove that."

"You're absolutely right. And the irony is that I preach that philosophy to students all the time—that mistakes don't define you, that growth is possible, that we should give people chances to change. But when it came to actually applying it, I failed. I let institutional pressure and fear of another scandal override my stated principles."

"At least you recognize it now."

"Thanks to you. You held me accountable without even meaning to."

"Which brings me to the next thing." My father took a breath. "I know you care about Noah. That there's something developing between you. And I want you to know—I'm not going to stand in the way of that."

"You're not?"

"You're seventeen. Almost an adult. You don't need my permission for who you spend time with or care about. But more than that—I trust your judgment. You've proven this week that you see people clearly, that you make thoughtful decisions even when they're difficult. If you choose Noah, I trust there are good reasons for that choice."

The relief was overwhelming. I'd been preparing myself for objections, for concerns about propriety and appearances.

"I do care about him," I admitted. "More than I probably should given everything that's happened."

"Why shouldn't you? He's intelligent, passionate about things he believes in, and—according to multiple teachers—respectful and hardworking. The fact that he made a mistake two years ago doesn't define him. You understand that better than most people."

"Some people will have opinions. About the headmaster's daughter dating a student on probation."

"Some people always have opinions. The question is whether you're living your life for them or for yourself."

I smiled despite my tears. "When did you get wise?"

"I've always been wise. I'm just finally learning to parent you the way your mother would have wanted." His own eyes were wet now. "She'd want you to be happy. Not perfect. Happy."

"I think I'm starting to understand the difference."

"Good. Because happiness is what matters. Not appearances, not what the board thinks, not maintaining some perfect image. I want you to make choices based on what you actually want, not what you think you should want."

We sat in silence for a moment, both processing the conversation. It felt like something fundamental had shifted between us.

"I miss her," I said quietly. "Every day. But especially times like this. She always knew the right thing to say."

"She did. I've been trying to be both parents to you, and I'm not equipped for that. I'm learning as I go."

"You're doing okay."

"I'm doing better now that I've stopped trying to keep you in a protective bubble. You don't need protecting. You need support and trust."

"Thank you. For understanding. For trusting me."

"Thank you for reminding me what courage looks like. For showing me that standing up for what's right matters more than maintaining comfortable appearances." He stood up, and I did too. He pulled me into a hug. "Your mother would be so proud of you. I know I am."

I hugged him back, feeling five years of tension and unspoken grief finally beginning to ease.

When we pulled apart, both of us wiping at our eyes, I felt lighter than I had in years. The weight of impossible perfection had lifted. The fear of disappointment had released its grip.

"So," my father said, trying for a lighter tone. "Fall Formal is Monday night."

"It is."

"Are you planning to attend with anyone in particular?"

"Dad—"

"I'm just asking. As your father. Not as the headmaster."

I smiled. "Noah and I haven't made specific plans. But we might... happen to find each other there."

"That sounds perfectly reasonable. Coincidental, even."

"Exactly."

"The deep blue dress your mother bought you sophomore year would look lovely. She always said blue was your color."

"I was thinking about wearing something different. Maybe shopping tomorrow."

"That sounds good. Choose something that makes you happy. Not something appropriate or expected. Something you love."

"I will."

As I left his office, I felt the full weight of what had just happened. My father had given me permission—not just to date Noah, but to be myself. To choose happiness over perfection. To stop living for everyone else's expectations and start living for my own desires.

For five years since Mom died, I'd been holding my breath. Playing it safe. Trying to be perfect so no one would worry about me, so I wouldn't add to my father's burdens.

But tonight, for the first time, I exhaled.

And it felt like freedom.
