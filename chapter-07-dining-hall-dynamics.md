# Chapter 7: Dining Hall Dynamics

Tuesday evening dinner at Riverside Academy was formal—proper dress required, doors closed at six-fifteen sharp, assigned seating at house tables that reinforced social hierarchies.

I arrived at six-ten. The dining hall was already filling, the smell of roasted chicken and the sound of conversation creating the atmosphere of institutional dining trying to be civilized.

The student council table was near the tall windows overlooking the quad, a position of visibility that I'd never particularly wanted but had learned to accept. Meredith was already seated, saving the chair next to her.

"Punctual as always," she said as I sat down. "One of these days I want to see you show up exactly at six-fifteen just to prove you can cut it that close."

"That would cause a minor panic attack," I admitted, reaching for the water pitcher. "My father would notice, and then I'd spend dinner wondering if he thought I was being irresponsible."

"The joys of living under constant surveillance," Meredith said dryly.

Other student council members joined us—Marcus Chen, Sarah Williams, others whose company I tolerated more than enjoyed. Shared duties rather than genuine connection. Except Meredith.

Faculty members took their seats at the high table, my father at the center. He scanned the dining hall with practiced awareness, checking who sat where, maintaining social oversight.

His eyes found me briefly and he nodded. I nodded back.

Servers brought the meal—roasted chicken, vegetables, rice—and we began passing dishes. The student council conversation turned to Fall Formal planning, homecoming activities, college deadlines.

I participated appropriately, but part of my attention was across the dining hall where Noah sat with Tyler Bradford and other students I recognized but didn't know well.

Their table wasn't "popular"—Riverside had those, though we pretended we didn't. Day students, scholarship students, kids who didn't fit the legacy-family aesthetic. Noah looked more relaxed than in class.

"Earth to Kelsey," Meredith said quietly. "You're staring."

I snapped my attention back to my own table, heat creeping up my neck. "I wasn't staring."

"You were definitely staring. At a specific table. With a specific transfer student."

"I was just noticing where people sit. That's all."

Meredith gave me a knowing look but didn't push. At the other end of our table, Marcus was discussing debate team strategy with Sarah, and they hadn't noticed my distraction.

Sloane Whitmore sat three tables over with senior girls who wore their blazers like fashion statements and moved through Riverside like they owned it. Legacy students from families who'd attended for generations.

Sloane's voice carried across the dining hall, louder than necessary.

"I just think it's interesting," she was saying to her tablemates, though her volume suggested she wanted a wider audience. "Some people have such a savior complex. They think they can fix someone who's clearly broken."

One of her friends laughed. "Who are you talking about?"

"Oh, no one specific." Sloane's tone was innocent, but her eyes flicked deliberately toward Noah's table. "Just observing patterns. Girls who go for the bad boy because they think they're different, they're special, they can change him."

More laughter from her table. Students at nearby tables were listening now, the gossip spreading through proximity.

"Especially when the bad boy has a history of making terrible decisions," Sloane continued. "Getting kicked out of schools, destroying property, embarrassing his family. But sure, maybe this time will be different. Maybe the right girl with the right motivation can reform him."

My jaw tightened. She was talking about Noah, obviously, but the insinuation was about me too. The headmaster's daughter trying to "fix" the troubled transfer student. Never mind that we were just working on a class project. Never mind that Noah was more thoughtful and principled than half the students at Riverside who'd never questioned anything in their privileged lives.

Meredith touched my arm lightly. "Don't react. That's what she wants."

She was right. Reacting would only confirm that Sloane's commentary bothered me, would feed the gossip. So I kept my expression neutral, continued eating my dinner, and pretended I hadn't heard anything.

But across the dining hall, I saw Noah's shoulders tense. He'd heard it too. Tyler said something to him, probably urging him to ignore it, and Noah nodded but didn't look up from his plate.

The meal continued with Sloane's pointed comments creating an undercurrent of awkwardness. By the time dessert was served—apple crisp with vanilla ice cream—the whole dining hall seemed aware of the subtext playing out.

When my father stood to make announcements, I was grateful for the distraction. He spoke about college admissions visits, transcript deadlines, a faculty lecture series.

Then: "I'd also like to remind all students that public commentary that diminishes others has no place at this school."

His eyes swept the hall without landing on Sloane specifically. He didn't need to. Everyone knew.

Sloane's smile faltered slightly before she recovered, whispering to her friends.

Dinner concluded at seven. Students dispersed to library, common rooms, dorms. I stood with Meredith when my father appeared.

"Kelsey, could I have a word?"

My stomach sank. "Of course."

Meredith gave me a sympathetic look and left. My father guided me to the windows where we had privacy.

"Is everything alright?" he asked, his voice gentle but concerned.

"Fine. Why?"

"I've been hearing... observations. About you spending time with Noah Bennett."

Of course he had. Riverside was small, and gossip traveled fast, especially gossip involving the headmaster's daughter.

"We're partners for Mr. Webb's debate project," I said carefully. "We met in the library to work on the assignment. That's all."

"I understand. I'm simply concerned about perception. Mr. Bennett is on probation. His history raises questions. I don't want your reputation affected."

"Dad, he's a good person who made one mistake for principled reasons—"

"I'm sure that's true. But perception matters, especially for you. College applications are approaching. Your record needs to be beyond question."

"My record is beyond question."

"I know. I'm just asking you to be mindful. Dean Patterson has expressed concerns. Other students are noticing." He gestured toward where Sloane's table had been. "I heard what was said. It was inappropriate, and I addressed it. But the best way to stop gossip is to not give it fuel."

He meant well. He loved me, wanted to protect me. But his solution was always the same—be more careful, be more perfect.

"I understand," I said, because I did understand. I just didn't agree.

"Thank you." He squeezed my shoulder briefly. "I trust your judgment, Kelsey. I always have. Just... be wise about where you direct your energy senior year."

He left to speak with faculty members still lingering near the high table. I stood by the windows, watching the last students leave the dining hall, feeling the familiar frustration of being managed instead of trusted.

Meredith was waiting in the hallway outside.

"That looked fun," she said without preamble.

"He wants me to be careful about spending time with Noah. Reputation concerns."

We started walking toward South Hall, the evening air cool and sharp with autumn. Campus paths were lit with old-fashioned lamp posts, creating pools of golden light against the darkening sky.

"And what do you think?" Meredith asked.

"I think Noah is the first person I've had an actually interesting conversation with in years, and I'm tired of everyone assuming the worst about him based on one incident they don't even understand the full context of."

"Okay, wow. That was passionate."

I stopped walking. "Was it?"

"Very. Defensive, even." Meredith studied my face. "You really like him."

"I like that he's smart and thoughtful and doesn't treat me like the headmaster's daughter."

"Uh-huh. And?"

"And nothing. We're debate partners. We had one library meeting where we actually talked about real things instead of just school politics and college applications. That's it."

"Kelsey." Meredith's voice was gentle. "I watched you at dinner. You noticed exactly where he was sitting. You tensed up when Sloane started her performance. You were three seconds from defending him publicly before I stopped you."

"So?"

"So you care what happens to him. Which is fine, by the way. He seems like a decent person who got a raw deal. I'm just saying you might want to acknowledge to yourself that this is more than academic partnership."

We resumed walking, and I didn't respond immediately because I wasn't sure what to say. Was it more than academic partnership? I enjoyed talking to Noah. I respected his principles. I was interested in his perspective. But that didn't mean...

"He's interesting," I finally admitted. "I like talking to someone who sees the world differently than the Riverside bubble."

"That's valid. Just be aware that your father isn't the only one who's noticed. You're drawing attention, and whether that's fair or not, it's happening."

"I know." We reached South Hall and climbed the stairs to our floor. "I just wish I could have one normal friendship without it becoming a political calculation."

"Welcome to being the headmaster's daughter," Meredith said. "Population: you."

In our room, I changed out of my dinner clothes and into comfortable pajama pants and a sweatshirt. My phone showed a text from an unknown number: *Hey, it's Noah. Tyler gave me your number. Sorry about dinner. Sloane's just bitter. Don't let it get to you.*

I stared at the message for a long moment before typing back: *It didn't. See you next Tuesday for project work?*

His response came quickly: *Definitely. Looking forward to it.*

Looking forward to it. Such a simple phrase, but it made me smile.

Meredith noticed. "Let me guess. Message from your debate partner?"

"Maybe."

"And you're smiling."

"Maybe."

"You're in so much trouble, Kelsey Morrison."

She was probably right.

But for the first time in years, I didn't mind being in trouble.
