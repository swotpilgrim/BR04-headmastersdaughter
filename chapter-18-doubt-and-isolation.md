# Chapter 18: Doubt and Isolation

Tuesday on campus felt like walking through a minefield. Everywhere I went, students whispered and cast glances my way, wondering what the headmaster's daughter thought about Noah Bennett's impending expulsion.

I kept my head down and my expression neutral, but inside I was screaming.

At breakfast, the dining hall buzzed with conversations that all circled back to the same topic. Noah remained confined to North Hall—invisible but omnipresent in every discussion. Dean Patterson had spent Monday evening and all day Tuesday interviewing students, methodically building his case.

"I heard Patterson has like five witnesses who saw Bennett near the gym Sunday night," someone behind me said.

"Plus the spray paint access from art class. Sloane Whitmore told people he was always getting in trouble at their old school too."

I pushed eggs around my plate, appetite gone. Meredith watched me with concerned eyes.

"You okay?" she asked.

"Not really. The hearing's tomorrow morning."

"I know." Less than twenty-four hours. And I had no evidence beyond my conviction.

Across the hall, Tyler sat alone at Noah's usual table. Other students had distanced themselves after his outburst defending Noah. Guilt by association.

I wanted to sit with him, but couldn't. Not before I had something concrete.

---

Between periods, I spotted Sloane with her friends, her voice carrying over the noise.

"I tried to warn people about Noah when I transferred. He had serious issues at our old school. But nobody wanted to believe me."

"It must be hard, having dated him," her friend said.

"I thought a new school would help him change, but leopards don't change their spots. The hearing tomorrow is really just a formality."

I walked past without eye contact, hands clenched around my textbooks. Sloane was enjoying this—the drama, the attention.

In calculus, the teacher had to call for quiet twice because students kept whispering. Even she seemed distracted, glancing toward Noah's empty seat in the back row like it was evidence of guilt.

The whole campus had turned into a jury that had already delivered its verdict. Guilty. No question. No doubt.

---

At lunch, Dean Patterson appeared in the dining hall. He walked between tables, his presence a reminder of institutional authority.

He stopped at several tables, asking questions. Students straightened when he approached, eager to cooperate.

I watched as he interviewed a junior boy who nodded vigorously and pointed toward the gymnasium. Another witness placing Noah at the scene. More confirmation of what everyone believed.

"It's a witch hunt," Meredith muttered. "They've already decided."

One of the council members overheard. "You don't think Bennett did it?"

I hesitated. "I think he deserves a fair investigation."

"He's getting one."

"Is he?" I didn't push further.

Across the hall, Patterson approached Tyler's table. Tyler responded with visible frustration, gesturing emphatically. Patterson's expression remained skeptical.

---

After lunch, I found Sloane in the library. She looked up, surprised.

"Kelsey. This is unexpected."

I sat down across from her, keeping my voice low. "I wanted to ask you about Noah. About what happened at your previous school."

Her eyebrows rose. "Really. Why would you ask me?"

"Because you knew him before. You dated him."

"Briefly. Before he self-destructed."

"What actually happened? At his old school?"

Sloane leaned back in her chair, clearly enjoying being the authority on this topic. "Noah vandalized the statue of the school's founder during a major donor event. Spray-painted it with graffiti criticizing the school's history. It was this huge scandal—donors were furious, the board demanded action, and Noah was expelled immediately."

"Why did he do it?"

She shrugged. "Impulsive and self-destructive. Always questioning authority. I thought it was exciting at first, but then exhausting."

"Did he have a reason? For the vandalism?"

"He claimed the founder had some racist history and the school shouldn't be honoring him. Which, okay, maybe he had a point. But there are ways to protest that don't involve destroying property during a fundraising gala." Sloane's expression turned almost sympathetic. "Look, I get why you're asking. You've been spending time with Noah, doing that debate project. But trust me—he's not who you think he is."

"What do you mean?"

"He's charming when he wants to be. Thoughtful, intelligent, all that. But underneath, he's angry. He has this need to rebel against everything, to prove he doesn't need anyone's approval. And eventually, that leads to exactly this." She gestured vaguely toward the window. "Another school, another act of vandalism, another expulsion. It's a pattern."

I stood up. "Thanks for your time."

"Kelsey?" Sloane's voice stopped me at the doorway. "Be careful. I know what it's like to care about Noah and then watch him self-destruct. It's not worth it."

I left without responding, but her words echoed in my head as I walked through the library. Was I wrong about Noah? Was my judgment clouded by my feelings for him? Everyone else seemed so certain of his guilt—Dean Patterson, the students, even Sloane who'd actually known him at his previous school.

Maybe I was the one seeing things that weren't there, inventing reasons to believe in someone who didn't deserve it.

By late afternoon, I felt desperate enough to bend the rules. I couldn't visit Noah officially, but North Hall wasn't locked during the day. If I could just get close enough to his room, maybe leave a note under his door, let him know someone believed in him...

I walked to North Hall after my last class, trying to look casual. I climbed the stairs to the second floor where Noah's room was located.

Halfway down the hallway, I stopped.

Dean Patterson stood outside Noah's door, talking to someone I couldn't see. My heart sank. Of course he'd be here. Of course Noah would be supervised even in his own dorm.

I turned and walked quickly back down the stairs before anyone noticed me.

Outside North Hall, I leaned against the brick wall and fought back frustrated tears. Every avenue was blocked. I couldn't talk to Noah, couldn't reassure him, couldn't even let him know I was trying to help.

He was completely isolated, facing this alone.

---

Dinner was mandatory. I ate mechanically, counting the hours. Eighteen hours.

My father made a brief announcement about respecting the process. It was useless. The rumors were already facts. Noah was guilty. The hearing was a formality.

When dinner ended, I stayed in my seat while other students filed out. Tyler was still sitting alone at his table across the room. Our eyes met.

He stood and walked over, sliding into the seat Meredith had just vacated.

"This is a nightmare," he said quietly.

"I know."

"I told Patterson Noah was with me Sunday night. We watched a movie with six other guys. Noah went to bed by ten-thirty. But Patterson acted like I was lying."

"The other witnesses?"

"He said he'd interview them, but didn't believe me. He's convinced Noah snuck out after curfew." Tyler ran a hand through his hair. "I can't even talk to Noah. Can't let him know I'm fighting for him."

"I tried to visit. Patterson was supervising."

"They're making sure Noah has no support. It's deliberate."

We sat in silence. The hall emptied around us.

"I believe he's innocent, but I can't prove it," I said.

Tyler looked at me directly. "Do you really believe it?"

The same question everyone asked.

"I really believe it. The graffiti doesn't fit. Noah wouldn't mock traditions he barely knows. It's not who he is."

"Then we figure out who did." Tyler's expression hardened. "Because if we don't have answers by morning, Noah's done."

---

Back in my dorm room, I tried to study but couldn't concentrate. Meredith worked on her own homework, occasionally glancing at me with concern.

Around nine, she closed her textbook. "Okay. Let's talk strategy."

"What?"

"For tomorrow. For finding evidence. We have—" she checked her watch "—about twelve hours before that hearing. So let's figure out what we can actually do."

I sat up on my bed. "I don't even know where to start."

"Start with what doesn't make sense. What about the graffiti bothers you?"

I thought about the crude images I'd seen Monday morning. "It's not artistic. Noah sketches all the time—I've seen his work. It's detailed, careful. The graffiti was just... sloppy."

"What else?"

"The content. It mocked specific Riverside traditions. Dining hall formality, dress codes, things a new student wouldn't necessarily know to target. Noah's only been here a few weeks."

Meredith nodded. "So whoever did it knows Riverside well enough to mock its specific culture."

"And did it crudely enough that it doesn't look like Noah's style at all."

"First thing tomorrow, we examine that graffiti closely," Meredith decided. "Look for details everyone else missed because they were too busy assuming Noah did it. Then we figure out who actually had motive, means, and opportunity."

"In twelve hours."

"In twelve hours." Meredith's expression was fierce. "We can do this, Kelsey. We have to."

I looked at my best friend, grateful and terrified in equal measure. She was right. We had to try.

Because tomorrow morning, Noah would walk into that hearing with no defense, no support, and no real chance unless we found something to change the predetermined outcome.

The question was whether twelve hours would be enough time to find the truth.

Or whether I'd have to watch injustice happen while I stood by, silent and helpless.

Neither option was acceptable.

So I'd have to make sure we succeeded.
