# Chapter 25: Fall Formal Preparation

Saturday morning, Meredith knocked on my door at eight AM with coffee and determination.

"We're going dress shopping," she announced. "The Fall Formal is Monday night and you need something amazing."

I sat up in bed, pushing hair out of my face. "I have dresses. I have that burgundy one from last year—"

"That burgundy dress made you look like you were attending a funeral, not a dance. We're finding something that makes you feel beautiful. Something you actually love."

"Meredith—"

"Your exact words last night were 'choose something that makes you happy.' So we're going to find a dress that makes you happy. Get dressed. We have permission to go into town and we're leaving in twenty minutes."

I couldn't argue with her logic. Or her enthusiasm.

The dress shops in the small town near Riverside Academy catered to boarding school formal events. We tried the first shop, where I immediately gravitated toward a safe black dress—classic, appropriate, forgettable.

Meredith physically steered me away from it.

"No. We're not doing safe. We're finding something that makes you feel confident and beautiful. Not invisible."

"I don't want to stand out too much—"

"Kelsey Morrison. You just spent a week investigating a crime, confronting guilty students, and fighting for justice. You stood up to your father and Dean Patterson. You're dating the guy everyone thought was a troublemaker. Standing out is kind of your thing now."

She had a point.

In the second shop, Meredith started pulling dresses—bold colors, interesting cuts, nothing like what I'd normally choose. I tried on a red dress that was too dramatic, making me look like I was trying too hard. A green one that clashed with my skin tone. A silver one that felt too flashy, like I was going to prom in a disco ball.

"These aren't working," I said, frustrated.

"Because you're still thinking about how other people will see you. Stop doing that. Think about how you want to feel."

"I want to feel confident. Beautiful. Like myself but the best version of myself."

"Good. Now what colors make you feel that way?"

I thought about it. "Blue. I've always liked blue."

Meredith disappeared into the racks and returned with several blue dresses. One was too pale, washing me out. One was too structured, like business wear. But then she handed me a deep blue dress.

"Try this one."

I stepped into the dressing room and slipped it on. The dress was midnight blue with delicate straps and a fitted bodice that flared slightly at the waist. Not revealing, not overly dramatic, but undeniably beautiful. The color brought out my eyes and made my skin glow. The cut was elegant without being stuffy.

I looked at myself in the mirror and barely recognized the girl staring back. Not because I looked different, exactly. But because I looked like myself—confident, alive, present. Not trying to disappear into the background or blend into the wallpaper.

My mother had always said blue was my color. I'd forgotten that until now.

"Kelsey, let me see!" Meredith called.

I stepped out of the dressing room. Meredith's face lit up.

"That's it. That's the dress. Oh my God, you look amazing. You look like you, but glowing."

"It's not too much?"

"It's perfect. How do you feel in it?"

I turned back to the mirror, really looking. "I feel... beautiful. Actually beautiful. Not appropriate or acceptable. Just... me. The me I want to be."

"Then we're getting it. No arguments."

"My mom would have loved this dress," I said quietly. "She always said blue was my color."

Meredith squeezed my hand. "She'd be proud of you. For everything this week. For choosing happiness."

"I think she would be too."

As the shop assistant wrapped the dress, Meredith was already planning accessories and shoes. Her enthusiasm was infectious. For the first time in my life, preparing for a school event actually felt fun instead of obligatory.

"So," Meredith said as we walked back to campus, dress bag carefully carried. "Are you going to tell me about your plans for Monday night? Or are you going to pretend you're not hoping to spend the entire evening with Noah?"

My face heated. "We haven't made specific plans."

"But you're hoping."

"I'm hoping."

"Good. You deserve to have fun at this thing. To actually enjoy yourself instead of just fulfilling social obligations."

"When did you get so wise?"

"I've always been wise. You're just finally listening."

Saturday afternoon, I needed space to think. The conversation with my father last night had unlocked something in me—permission to choose my own happiness. But the weight of five years of careful behavior didn't disappear overnight.

I walked to Lakeside Point, the quiet spot by the river where students rarely ventured. The November cold had driven most people indoors, which suited me perfectly. I sat on the familiar bench, watching the river flow past, autumn leaves caught in the current.

"I thought I might find you here."

I turned to see Noah approaching, hands in his jacket pockets, his breath visible in the cold air.

"How did you know where to look?"

"Tyler mentioned you like this spot. Mind if I join you?"

"Please."

He sat beside me, close enough that our shoulders almost touched. For a moment we just sat in comfortable silence, watching the water.

"So," Noah said eventually. "Fall Formal is Monday night."

"It is."

"Are you planning to go?"

"I have to go. Student council secretary. It's expected." I paused. "But for the first time, I think I might actually want to go. Not just because it's expected."

"What changed?"

"I got a new dress. Talked to my father. Realized I could choose to enjoy things instead of just enduring them." I looked at him. "Are you going?"

"I've been thinking about it. I've never been to a school dance where I actually wanted to be there. Where I felt like I belonged instead of like an outsider everyone's watching."

"And now?"

"Now I think maybe it could be different. If I had a reason to want to be there."

My heart was beating faster. "What kind of reason?"

Noah turned to face me fully. "The kind of reason where I spend the whole night talking to someone I actually care about. Dancing with her if she'll let me. Not worrying about what anyone else thinks because being with her is worth whatever judgment comes with it."

"Noah—"

"I know asking you officially as my date would create complications. Your father just gave his approval and we don't want to push things too fast. People would talk. Dean Patterson would probably have opinions."

"Probably," I agreed, though part of me wanted to say forget the complications.

"So what if we both just happened to attend?" Noah suggested, his eyes warm. "And we happened to find each other there. And we happened to spend most of the evening together. No official date. Just... us, choosing to be together."

"That sounds perfect," I said, smiling. "Coincidental, even."

"Exactly. Very coincidental that the headmaster's daughter and I keep ending up in the same place."

"Pure chance."

"Though I should warn you," Noah said, his tone becoming more serious. "I've never actually been to a formal dance. I don't know if I know how to dance properly. You might end up regretting spending the evening with someone who steps on your feet."

"I don't care about proper dancing. I care about being with someone I want to be with."

"Even if people whisper? Even if some students judge you for choosing me?"

"Let them. I spent five years trying to be perfect for everyone else. This week taught me that the only person I need to be perfect for is myself. And being with you feels right. That's what matters."

Noah reached for my hand, linking our fingers together. The gesture felt natural, comfortable. Like we'd been doing this for years instead of days.

"I'm nervous," he admitted. "About Monday. About what it means to be publicly together like that. About living up to what you deserve."

"I'm nervous too. But the good kind of nervous. The excited kind."

"You got a new dress?"

"Deep blue. Meredith says it makes me look confident and beautiful instead of invisible."

"You've never been invisible to me," Noah said quietly. "From the first day we worked on that debate project, you were the only person in the room."

My breath caught. "Noah—"

"I know it's fast. I know we're still figuring this out. But Kelsey, you saved me. Not just from expulsion. You saw me when everyone else saw a reputation. You fought for me when no one else would. You trusted your judgment about who I am instead of what everyone said I was. How could I not fall for you?"

"You're falling for me?"

"I fell weeks ago. I just didn't let myself acknowledge it until this week. Until you proved that this—us—might actually be possible."

I leaned closer, resting my head on his shoulder. He wrapped his arm around me, pulling me against his warmth.

"Monday night," I said. "We'll both happen to be at the Fall Formal."

"Completely coincidentally."

"And we'll happen to find each other."

"Pure chance."

"And we'll spend the evening together being happy instead of perfect."

"That sounds like the best plan I've ever heard."

We sat there as the afternoon light faded, wrapped together against the November cold. The river flowed past, carrying autumn leaves downstream. In two days, we'd walk into the Fall Formal together—not officially, but together nonetheless.

And for the first time in five years, I was genuinely excited about a school event. Not because it was expected or required. But because I'd chosen it. Chosen him. Chosen happiness over perfection.

The girl I'd been a month ago would never have taken this risk. Would never have let herself fall for someone complicated, someone who came with judgment and whispers.

But that girl was gone. In her place was someone braver. Someone who trusted her own judgment over everyone else's assumptions.

Someone who was finally, genuinely happy.
