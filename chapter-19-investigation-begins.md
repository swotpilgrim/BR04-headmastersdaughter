# Chapter 19: Investigation Begins

Tuesday evening. The day before the hearing.

I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep despite Meredith's gentle snoring from across the room. My mind kept circling back to the same question: who did this?

The graffiti appeared Monday morning. The vandalism happened Sunday night. Noah was supposedly seen near the gymnasium Sunday evening, but dozens of students were there after the basketball game that afternoon. Being near the gym didn't prove anything.

I rolled over, checking my phone. 11:47 PM. The hearing started at nine AM tomorrow. Less than ten hours.

If I couldn't sleep, I might as well do something useful.

I slipped out of bed and pulled on jeans and a sweater. Meredith stirred.

"Kelsey? Where are you going?"

"Can't sleep. Going for a walk."

She sat up, instantly alert. "You're going to investigate, aren't you?"

I hesitated, then nodded.

Meredith threw back her covers. "Give me two minutes."

At quarter past midnight, we stood outside the gymnasium. The October air was brutally cold, our breath visible in white clouds, fingers already going numb despite our gloves. The campus was eerily silent except for distant sounds from the security office and the wind rattling through bare tree branches.

The graffiti sprawled across the brick wall, visible even in the dim exterior lighting. I'd seen it Monday morning, but then I'd been shocked and overwhelmed by the crowd and accusations. Now I needed to look at it analytically, objectively.

I'd borrowed a camera from the school newspaper office earlier that evening—told the editor I wanted to document it for a potential opinion piece. Now I started taking photos, methodically documenting everything from wide shots to close-up details.

"What are you looking for?" Meredith asked quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Anything that doesn't fit Noah being the culprit. Anything that points to who actually did this."

I examined the spray-painted images carefully. The Riverside seal was drawn crudely—distorted features, uneven lines, sloppy execution. The kind of work someone would do working fast without care for precision or artistry. The proportions were all wrong. The river that should run behind the main building was drawn in front of it. The chapel spire was too short.

"Look at this," I said, gesturing to one section. Words in angry red paint ridiculed formal dinners and dress codes. "Down with Dead Traditions." "Bow Ties are Oppression." "Mandatory Fun = Oxymoron."

"What about it?"

"These are references to specific Riverside traditions. Really specific ones. The bow tie requirement for senior boys at formal dinners. The 'community building exercises' Dean Patterson organizes that everyone jokes are mandatory fun. That's inside knowledge. Someone who just arrived a few weeks ago wouldn't know to mock these particular things."

Meredith leaned closer, studying the graffiti. "The style is sloppy too. I've seen Noah's sketches in class—he's always doodling in the margins of his notes. He draws detailed faces with careful shading. Even his casual sketches show technique. This looks like someone working fast who didn't care about quality."

Exactly what I'd been thinking. Noah's work had precision. This was crude vandalism without any artistic merit.

I took more photos, documenting the crude execution, the specific cultural references, the evidence of hasty work.

"Let's talk to the custodial staff," I said. "They work night shifts. They might have seen something Sunday evening that didn't seem important at the time."

---

We found Mr. Chen, the head custodian, in the maintenance building. He looked surprised to see students at this hour but didn't send us away. Mr. Chen had always been kind to students, never treating us like we were in his way.

"Mr. Chen, we're sorry to bother you so late," I said. "We wanted to ask about Sunday night. The graffiti. Did you see anything unusual?"

Mr. Chen considered this carefully. "I was working the north quad Sunday evening. That's on the opposite side of campus from the gymnasium. Didn't get to the athletic area until Monday morning around six AM for my regular rounds. That's when I discovered the vandalism and reported it to security immediately."

"Were other staff working Sunday night? Anyone who might have been near the gymnasium?"

"Sarah was on duty for the athletic buildings. She might have seen something. Try the field house."

We found Sarah cleaning the field house locker rooms. She was a friendly woman in her fifties who always said hello to students and remembered everyone's names. She looked up from mopping and smiled.

"Kelsey, Meredith. You're up late. Everything okay?"

"We're trying to understand what happened Sunday night," I explained. "With the graffiti. Did you see anything unusual?"

Sarah leaned on her mop, thinking carefully. "Sunday night. The basketball game ended around five. Lots of students near the gymnasium afterward, heading back to dorms. Groups of boys, mostly, like usual after games. It was getting dark and hard to identify specific people."

"Did you notice anyone behaving suspiciously? Anyone who seemed out of place?"

"Not really. Just typical post-game energy. Kids laughing, talking loud, full of adrenaline from the game. I remember thinking how cold it was—must have been below forty degrees—and wondering why they were hanging around outside instead of heading straight to their warm dorms." She paused, her expression thoughtful. "There was one group near the side entrance to the gym around six-thirty. Three or four boys. I noticed them because they seemed to be hanging back from the main crowd, staying in the shadows near the building."

My pulse quickened. "Can you describe them?"

"Not clearly, I'm afraid. It was dark and I was inside looking out through the windows. Younger students, I think. Definitely not seniors—they were shorter, less filled out. Could have been sophomores or juniors."

"How did they seem? Their behavior?"

"Excited. Maybe a little nervous? They kept looking around, checking if anyone was watching them. But I assumed it was just post-game adrenaline or maybe they were sneaking off to smoke, which I definitely wasn't going to investigate on my own." Sarah looked concerned. "Should I have reported something? Is this connected to that poor Bennett boy being accused?"

"No, you couldn't have known," I assured her. "You're being very helpful. Thank you."

As we walked back to our dorm through the freezing darkness, Meredith said quietly, "A group of younger boys near the gym Sunday evening. Nervous, checking if anyone was watching. That's suspicious."

"But it doesn't prove anything specific. Lots of students were there. And Sarah couldn't identify them."

"But it's a pattern. The graffiti references inside jokes younger students would know. Someone saw younger boys acting suspicious. The execution is amateur, not skilled."

She was right. It was a pattern. But patterns weren't proof.

Back in our room, I spread my photos across my desk and stared at them. The graffiti mocked Riverside traditions with inside knowledge—"Bow Ties are Oppression," "Mandatory Fun = Oxymoron." The execution was crude and fast, lacking any artistic skill. Custodial staff had seen younger boys near the gym Sunday evening, acting nervous.

Who would do this? And how could I prove it?

---

I collapsed into bed just before three AM, exhausted but too wired to sleep immediately. The photos were on my phone. The evidence was circumstantial but compelling. The graffiti's style was wrong for Noah—he drew with precision and care. The content referenced traditions he wouldn't know as a transfer student. Custodial staff had seen younger boys acting suspiciously near the gym.

It was evidence, but not proof. Not enough to stop a hearing. Not enough to save Noah.

I set my alarm for six AM. Three hours of sleep if I could manage it. Then three more hours until the hearing started.

I had to find more. Had to find who actually did this.

Sleep wouldn't come. My mind kept working, circling around the same questions obsessively. Who would do this? Why? How could I prove it before nine o'clock? What was I missing?

The answer felt just out of reach, like trying to remember a name that sits on the tip of your tongue.

I must have drifted off eventually, because my alarm woke me from dreams of running through campus searching for something I couldn't name. Six AM. Three hours until the hearing. My last chance to find the truth.

---

At seven-thirty Wednesday morning, I walked to the dining hall for breakfast. The campus buzzed with nervous energy. Everyone knew about the hearing. Everyone had an opinion.

I forced myself to eat, though the food tasted like cardboard. Meredith sat beside me, quiet and worried.

Tyler appeared, sliding into the seat across from me. His expression was tense.

"Kelsey. I need to tell you something."

I looked up, seeing the urgency in his eyes.

"Monday morning in the locker room," Tyler said quietly. "After everyone found the graffiti. Some junior boys were acting weird. Laughing about 'making a statement' and how the administration was freaking out. At the time I thought they were just being insensitive about Noah getting blamed. But last night I couldn't sleep, and I kept thinking about it..."

My pulse quickened. "What did they say exactly?"

"Marcus Washington—you know him, junior, on the soccer team—he said something like, 'Bet the administration didn't see that coming.' And his friend Jake Porter laughed and said, 'Traditions aren't so sacred now, are they?' They seemed really pleased with themselves."

"Did they mention Noah?"

"Not directly. But when another guy brought up Noah being confined, they got quiet real fast. Like they suddenly realized there were actual consequences."

My heart was pounding now. "Who else was there? Besides Marcus and Jake?"

"Sam Turner. The three of them were together, acting like they had some private joke."

Three junior boys. Bragging about making a statement. Getting quiet when they heard about consequences.

"Tyler, where are these boys now?"

"Probably at breakfast. East side tables, that's where the juniors usually sit."

I stood up so fast my chair scraped loudly. "Thank you."

"Kelsey, what are you going to do?"

"Find the truth," I said. "The hearing starts in ninety minutes. This is my last chance."

Tyler's eyes widened. "Do you want me to come with you?"

"No. But be ready. I might need backup."

As I walked away, Meredith caught up to me. "You think those boys did it?"

"I think they know something. And I have ninety minutes to find out what."

My hands were shaking. This was it. The lead I needed.

Now I had to follow it before time ran out.
