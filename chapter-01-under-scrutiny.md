# Chapter 1: Under Scrutiny

I woke to September sunlight slanting through the lace curtains of my bedroom in the headmaster's residence, and my first thought was the same as every morning: someone is watching.

Not literally, of course. My room was on the second floor of the Victorian house at the edge of Riverside Academy's campus, private enough. But the awareness had settled into my bones over seventeen years of living here—the knowledge that my every move, every choice, every conversation would be observed, discussed, analyzed by four hundred students who saw me not as Kelsey Morrison but as the headmaster's daughter.

I dressed carefully for the first day of senior year. Navy skirt, white oxford shirt, cream cardigan. The Riverside dress code didn't require uniforms, but there was an unspoken expectation of preppy conformity that I'd learned to navigate without thinking. I checked my reflection in the mirror—hair brushed smooth, minimal makeup, nothing that could invite comment. Perfect was always the safest choice.

Downstairs, my younger brother Evan was already eating cereal at the kitchen table, still rumpled from sleep. He was fourteen and had somehow escaped the burden of being constantly scrutinized, maybe because he was a boy, maybe because he was younger, maybe just because he was better at not caring.

"First day of being a senior," he said, grinning at me. "Exciting?"

"Something like that." I poured coffee into a travel mug, the smell rich and grounding. My father had already left for his office in Morrison Hall—first day meant meetings with faculty before students arrived for breakfast.

I left through the side door and walked the brick path that connected our residence to the main campus. The morning air was crisp with the promise of autumn, and the Pemigewasset River beyond the academic buildings caught the early light. Riverside was beautiful, I had to admit that. Two hundred acres of carefully maintained grounds, brick buildings with ivy climbing their walls, the kind of traditional New England boarding school that appeared in catalogs and promotional materials.

Students were emerging from the dormitories, heading toward the dining hall in pairs and small groups. I recognized most of them—Riverside wasn't huge, and I'd been here my entire life. As I walked, they noticed me.

"Morning, Kelsey." A junior girl I barely knew, voice overly bright.

"Good morning." I smiled the appropriate amount.

A pair of senior boys stepped slightly off the path to let me pass, nodding respectfully. "Ms. Morrison."

Ms. Morrison. As if I were faculty instead of their classmate.

I felt the familiar weight settle across my shoulders—the awareness of being watched, judged, held to a different standard. These students didn't see a friend or peer. They saw the headmaster's daughter, someone whose favor might help them or whose father's disapproval could make their lives difficult. Or they avoided me entirely, not wanting the complication.

The dining hall—officially Riverside Commons—was already filling with students when I arrived. The building had tall windows overlooking the quad, wood-paneled walls decorated with house banners and framed photographs of graduating classes dating back decades, and long tables arranged in the assigned seating that reinforced Riverside's social structure. Morning light streamed through the windows, catching the polished wood floors and making the whole space glow golden. The smell of coffee and breakfast pastries mixed with the sound of conversation and laughter, creating the particular atmosphere of a boarding school breakfast—hundreds of teenagers forced into semi-formal dining before eight in the morning.

I spotted Meredith Collins at the student council table near the windows. She'd already claimed our usual seats, two cups of coffee waiting. Relief loosened something in my chest.

"Senior year," Meredith said as I sat down, her California accent still noticeable even after three years at Riverside. "We made it."

"We made it." I wrapped my hands around the warm mug and let myself relax slightly. Meredith was one of the few people who treated me like a normal person instead of a position.

She was a scholarship student from Los Angeles, brilliant and practical, with none of the careful politeness most students used around me. We'd been roommates since sophomore year, and she'd proven herself genuinely unimpressed by my father's authority. It made her one of my only real friends.

"I got my schedule finalized," Meredith said, pulling out a printed sheet. "English with Webb first period, then Calculus, then Chemistry. You?"

"Webb's English first period too. Then I have History, and student council meeting during free period." I took a sip of coffee. "Debate team practice after classes twice a week."

"Right, because you don't have enough responsibilities." Meredith's tone was dry but affectionate. "Student council secretary again?"

"Of course." I'd been secretary since sophomore year. It was expected.

Around us, the dining hall filled with students collecting breakfast from the buffet line and settling at their assigned house tables. I was aware of glances in our direction, the subtle observation that never quite stopped. A group of junior girls at the next table kept looking over, whispering.

"Ignore them," Meredith said, following my gaze. "They're probably just nervous about their own schedules."

But we both knew that wasn't true. They were watching me because everyone always watched me.

The faculty entrance opened, and teachers began filtering in to take their seats at the high table—a Riverside tradition that made every meal feel slightly formal. I straightened automatically, aware that my posture, my expression, everything about me reflected on my father.

Then Dr. Richard Morrison himself entered, and the dining hall's noise level dropped slightly. He wasn't an intimidating man physically—average height, graying hair, wire-rimmed glasses—but he carried authority naturally. Twelve years as Riverside's headmaster had given him a presence that commanded respect.

He surveyed the room, nodded to the faculty, and then his eyes found me. He crossed the dining hall, and I felt every student's attention shift to watch our interaction.

"Good morning, Kelsey." His voice was warm but formal, the tone he used in public. "Ready for senior year?"

"Good morning, Dad. Yes, all ready." I kept my voice level, appropriate.

"Excellent. I'll expect you at the student council meeting this afternoon—we have significant planning to discuss." He glanced at Meredith. "Miss Collins, good to see you back."

"Good to be back, Dr. Morrison." Meredith's response was polite but not obsequious.

My father returned to the high table, and the dining hall's normal noise level gradually returned. I released a breath I hadn't realized I was holding.

"That wasn't so bad," Meredith offered.

"It never is." That was part of the problem. My father wasn't cruel or unreasonable. He simply existed in a position that made my life constantly public. "He just reminds everyone who I am."

"You're Kelsey Morrison, senior, debate team member, excellent student, and occasionally my friend when you're not being the perfect headmaster's daughter."

I smiled despite myself. "Occasionally?"

"You do spend a lot of time being perfect. It's exhausting just watching you."

She meant it kindly, but the observation stung because it was true. I'd spent five years—ever since my mother died—being as perfect as possible. No mistakes, no scandals, no reasons for anyone to whisper about favoritism or question my father's judgment. My mother's death from cancer when I was twelve had left my father grieving and overwhelmed, suddenly a single parent trying to run a demanding school while raising two children alone. The least I could do was not cause him additional stress.

So I became perfect. Perfect grades, perfect behavior, perfect representation of everything Riverside valued. I stopped asking for things I wanted, stopped complaining, stopped doing anything that might add to his burden. I became the daughter who never caused problems, who always set the right example, who made his job easier instead of harder.

And I was so tired of it.

The morning announcements began, delivered by the student council president from the high table. Welcome back, important dates, reminders about dress code and curfew. The usual September business.

Then: "We're also pleased to announce that Riverside will be welcoming a new senior transfer student this week. Let's all make sure to extend our traditional Riverside hospitality."

A transfer student. That was unusual—Riverside rarely accepted students mid-high school, and almost never seniors. The room buzzed with curiosity and speculation.

"Wonder who that is," Meredith said. "Must have serious connections to transfer in as a senior."

"Or serious problems at their last school." The words came out more cynical than I intended.

Meredith raised an eyebrow. "Wow, judgmental much?"

"I'm just being realistic. Riverside doesn't take transfer seniors unless something went wrong somewhere else."

"Maybe they just needed a change."

"Maybe." But I doubted it. Riverside Academy was traditional, demanding, and expensive. Students came here for the college placement record and the prestigious reputation. They didn't transfer in their final year unless forced.

Around us, students finished breakfast and began dispersing toward first period classes. Meredith and I cleared our trays and headed out into the September morning. The campus was beautiful in the early light—brick buildings with white trim, carefully maintained lawns, the river visible between the trees.

"You okay?" Meredith asked as we walked toward Morrison Hall.

"Fine. Why?"

"You seem tense. More than usual first-day-of-school tense."

I considered lying, offering some easy reassurance. But Meredith was my closest friend, and she deserved honesty. "I'm just tired of it. All of it. Being watched, being judged, being the headmaster's daughter instead of just being me."

"So stop," Meredith said simply.

"Stop what?"

"Stop being so perfect. Make a mistake. Do something unexpected. Be interesting."

I laughed, but there was no humor in it. "I can't afford mistakes. You know that."

"Everyone can afford mistakes, Kelsey. That's what being seventeen is supposed to be about."

But she was wrong. Maybe other seventeen-year-olds could afford mistakes. I couldn't. Not when every choice I made reflected on my father's judgment, not when students were looking for any sign of favoritism or special treatment, not when I'd built my entire identity on being beyond reproach.

We reached Morrison Hall and climbed the stairs to the third floor where Mr. Webb's English classroom overlooked the river. The room was already filling with students, and I took my usual seat in the front row.

Senior year had begun.

And I had no idea how much it was about to change.
