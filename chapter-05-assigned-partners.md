# Chapter 5: Assigned Partners

Tuesday morning, I arrived at Mr. Webb's English classroom five minutes early and took my customary seat in the front row. The third-floor room overlooked the river, morning mist just lifting.

Mr. Webb was my favorite teacher at Riverside—one of the few who treated me like an actual student rather than an extension of my father's authority.

"Morning, Kelsey," he said. "Ready for senior year English?"

"Ready as I'll be. What are we starting with?"

"Civil disobedience and moral authority. Thoreau, Gandhi, King. Should generate interesting debates."

The classroom filled. Meredith sat two seats over, Tyler Bradford in the middle section. The bell rang just as Noah Bennett entered, slightly out of breath.

"Sorry," Noah said. "Got turned around in the hallways."

"No problem, first week navigation issues are expected. Noah Bennett, correct?" Mr. Webb consulted his roster. "Welcome to Senior English. Find a seat anywhere."

Noah headed to the back and took a seat by the windows, immediately looking out at the river rather than at the class. Here, surrounded by classmates who'd already judged him, he looked closed off again.

Mr. Webb discussed the syllabus—reading list, essay requirements, participation expectations—then shifted to our first major unit.

"Civil disobedience," he said, writing the term on the board. "The deliberate, public refusal to obey laws or commands of authority. We'll be reading Thoreau, examining Gandhi's philosophy, studying King's Letter from Birmingham Jail. But more importantly, we'll be debating a central question: when, if ever, is it morally justified to break rules?"

The class perked up. This was the kind of topic that generated actual discussion.

"To push your thinking beyond theoretical," Mr. Webb continued, "I'm assigning a major debate project. You'll work in pairs to construct arguments both for and against civil disobedience in a specific context. I want you to genuinely wrestle with the complexity."

He began reading partner assignments from his list, deliberately pairing students who would challenge each other. Tyler with Marcus Chen—the easygoing day student with the ambitious student council president. Meredith with Sarah Williams—two brilliant students who'd push each other intellectually.

"Kelsey Morrison and Noah Bennett," Mr. Webb said, checking something off his list.

My head snapped up. Around the room, I felt rather than saw students turning to look, surprised whispers starting.

"The headmaster's daughter and the new kid?" someone muttered behind me.

"This should be interesting," another voice added.

I kept my expression neutral, but my mind was racing. Mr. Webb had paired me with Noah deliberately—he did everything deliberately. He wanted us to challenge each other, bring different perspectives. What he didn't know was that Noah was on probation, that my father had concerns about my association with him, that this partnership would invite exactly the kind of scrutiny I usually tried to avoid.

I glanced back toward Noah. He was watching me with an unreadable expression, probably wondering if I'd protest the pairing.

I turned back to face front. If Mr. Webb had assigned this partnership, I'd do the work. That's what I did—fulfill responsibilities without complaint.

The rest of class passed in a blur of discussion about Thoreau. When the bell rang, students gathered their things and dispersed toward second period. I stood more slowly, trying to figure out whether to approach Noah about our project or wait for him to suggest meeting.

The decision was made for me when a girl I didn't recognize approached Noah at his desk. She was beautiful in an effortless way—long blonde hair, perfect skin, wearing the Riverside dress code like fashion instead of uniform. She moved with confidence that suggested she was used to attention.

"Noah," she said, her voice warm and familiar. "I thought that was you when I saw you yesterday, but I wasn't sure."

Noah looked up, and something shifted in his expression—recognition, but not exactly pleasure. "Sloane. Hey."

"Hey yourself." She perched on the edge of the desk next to his, crossing her legs. "I transferred here too. Can you believe it? After everything at Choate, we both end up at Riverside."

I was still gathering my things, moving slowly enough that I could hear their conversation without obviously eavesdropping. Meredith had already left for her next class.

"You transferred here?" Noah asked, his tone careful.

"Just for senior year. My family has legacy connections to Riverside, and after... well, after the whole statue incident, my parents thought a change of scenery would be good for both of us." She smiled, and it looked practiced. "So here we are. Together again."

Together again. The phrasing suggested history between them, relationship beyond casual acquaintance.

"We're not together, Sloane," Noah said quietly. "We haven't been together since sophomore year."

"Details." She waved a hand dismissively. "The point is, Riverside is small. We'll be seeing a lot of each other. Maybe we could grab coffee sometime, catch up properly?"

I shouldn't have cared. It was none of my business if Noah had history with this girl or if she was clearly interested in rekindling something. We'd had one honest conversation; that didn't mean anything.

But I felt bothered anyway, watching Sloane lean closer to Noah with obvious interest.

"I'm pretty busy," Noah said, standing and collecting his books. "Probation means I need to keep my grades up. Don't have much time for socializing."

"That's what you said at Choate too, and we managed." Sloane stood as well, not giving up easily. "Come on, Noah. We had fun before everything got complicated. Why not again?"

"Because I'm not interested in complicated." Noah's voice had an edge now. "I'm here to graduate and stay out of trouble. That's it."

Sloane's perfect smile faltered slightly. "You're being serious."

"Very serious. Sorry, Sloane. I'll see you around."

He headed toward the door without looking back. Sloane stood there for a moment, looking annoyed rather than hurt. Then her eyes landed on me, still standing at my desk, and her expression sharpened with something like assessment.

"You're the headmaster's daughter, right?" she asked.

"Kelsey Morrison," I confirmed.

"Sloane Whitmore." She smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "I heard Mr. Webb paired you with Noah for the debate project. Good luck with that. He's brilliant but... challenging to work with."

The comment felt loaded, like a warning or a claim of territory. I kept my voice neutral. "I'm sure we'll manage."

"I'm sure you will." Sloane collected her designer bag and headed for the door, pausing to add, "Just be careful. Noah has a tendency to pull people into his drama. Wouldn't want that to reflect badly on your father's position."

She left before I could respond, her heels clicking down the hallway.

"Everything okay?" Mr. Webb asked from his desk.

I'd forgotten he was still there, working on his laptop. "Fine. Just... meeting my project partner was interesting."

He smiled slightly. "I thought you two would make a good pairing. You're both excellent critical thinkers, and you approach problems from different angles. Should produce some sophisticated work."

"Did you know about Noah's situation? The probation?" I asked.

"I know he's a transfer student who deserves the same fair chance as anyone else," Mr. Webb said carefully. "I also know you're someone who judges people by their actions rather than their reputations. That's why I paired you."

I appreciated his faith in me, even if it complicated my life. "We haven't actually discussed when to meet for the project."

"Give him time to settle in. Maybe establish a work schedule by the end of the week." Mr. Webb closed his laptop. "And Kelsey? Don't let other people's opinions influence your judgment. Not even your father's."

The comment was more direct than teachers usually got with me. I nodded, grabbed my bag, and headed for the door.

In the hallway, I nearly collided with Noah, who was waiting outside the classroom.

"Sorry," he said, stepping back. "I wanted to catch you before you left for your next class."

"About the project?"

"Yeah. Look, I know this is probably awkward for you. Being paired with the problematic new kid." He shrugged. "If you want to ask Webb to reassign partners, I'd understand."

I studied his face, looking for signs of whether he actually wanted me to request reassignment or whether he was just anticipating rejection. His expression was guarded, defensive.

"Why would I want to reassign partners?" I asked.

"Because your father probably won't love the idea of you spending time with me. Because that girl Sloane is going to spread gossip about it. Because I'm on probation and association with me could cause you problems."

He wasn't wrong about any of those things. But something about his assumption that I'd choose the easy path over the right one bothered me.

"Mr. Webb assigned us as partners for a reason," I said. "I don't ask for reassignments just because something might be complicated. We'll do the project, we'll do it well, and we'll ignore whatever gossip happens. Sound good?"

Noah looked surprised. "You're sure?"

"I'm sure. Library Thursday at four?"

"Got it." He hesitated. "Thanks. For not asking for reassignment."

"You're welcome."

The warning bell rang.

"I should go. See you Thursday."

I headed down the hallway, aware of students watching.

Meredith caught me at my locker. "So. You and Noah Bennett. Debate partners."

"Apparently."

"And Sloane Whitmore was all over him. I heard from three people already."

"She knows him from Choate."

"And how do you feel about that?"

I pulled out my History textbook. "Why would I feel any way about it?"

"Because you got that look when I mentioned Sloane."

"What look?"

"The look you get when you're bothered but won't admit it."

"I'm not bothered. We had one honest conversation. That's it."

"Mm-hmm. Well, partnering with him will invite commentary."

"People always watch me. That's my life." I closed my locker. "I'm not asking for reassignment because of gossip."

Meredith smiled. "Good. He seems interesting, and you could use interesting in your perfectly controlled life."

"I could use less commentary from my best friend."

We headed to class, and I tried not to think about why the idea of spending time with Noah made me nervous.

Or why Sloane leaning close to him had bothered me more than it should.
