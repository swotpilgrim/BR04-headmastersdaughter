# Chapter 2: New Arrival

The administration office at Riverside Academy smelled like furniture polish and old paper, the kind of institutional smell that was probably the same in every boarding school across New England. I sat in a leather chair that was probably meant to intimidate students into good behavior, watching Dean Marcus Patterson review my file with the kind of expression that said he'd already decided I was a problem.

"Mr. Bennett." His voice was clipped, former military if I had to guess. Everything about him was pressed and precise—uniform crease in his khakis, polo shirt with the Riverside crest embroidered on the chest, posture that probably didn't relax even in sleep. "Let me be very clear about your situation here."

"Crystal clear," I said, keeping my voice neutral. I'd learned that sarcasm only made things worse with men like Patterson.

He didn't appreciate my response anyway. "You are being admitted to Riverside Academy on academic probation. This is highly unusual for a senior transfer, and it's being done as a courtesy due to your family's... connections."

Connections. That was a polite way of saying my parents had donated enough money to buy my way into a school that should never have accepted me. The thought made my jaw tight.

"One infraction," Patterson continued, tapping my file with his pen. "A single violation of school rules, and your enrollment will be immediately terminated. No appeals, no second chances. Do you understand?"

"I understand." What I understood was that he expected me to fail. It was written all over his face—the skepticism, the barely concealed anticipation of having his low expectations confirmed.

"Riverside Academy maintains high standards of conduct and academic excellence. We have a reputation to uphold." He slid a packet of papers across his desk. "Your class schedule, dorm assignment, and student handbook. I suggest you familiarize yourself with the rules immediately."

I took the packet without comment. North Hall, Room 214. Senior class schedule heavy on English and History, lighter on sciences—probably the best they could do matching credits from my previous school.

My previous school. Choate. Where I'd spent three years before one impulsive decision had gotten me expelled and sent here.

"The mandatory senior orientation assembly begins at eleven in Morrison Hall," Patterson said, checking his watch. "That gives you an hour to settle into your dormitory and... prepare yourself."

Prepare myself. For what, exactly? To be judged by four hundred strangers who'd already heard I was the kid who got kicked out?

"Thank you, Dean Patterson." I stood, collecting the orientation packet.

"Mr. Bennett." His voice stopped me at the door. "I'll be watching you closely. Very closely."

"I'd expect nothing less, sir."

I left before he could respond, stepping out of the administration building into September sunshine that felt too bright, too cheerful for my mood. The campus spread before me—brick buildings with white trim, perfectly manicured lawns, the kind of traditional New England boarding school architecture that screamed old money and older traditions. Trees lined the pathways, their leaves just beginning to hint at autumn color. In the distance, I could see the river that bordered the campus, water reflecting the morning light.

Riverside Academy. Two hundred acres of carefully maintained privilege and tradition. The kind of place my parents had always wanted me to appreciate, to fit into naturally. The kind of place I'd never quite managed to belong.

Beautiful, in an oppressive sort of way.

Students were walking between buildings, most of them wearing the kind of preppy casual that probably cost more than my entire wardrobe. Khakis and polo shirts, sundresses and cardigans, boat shoes and loafers. I fit the aesthetic physically—my parents had made sure I looked the part—but I knew I'd never fit otherwise.

I followed the campus map to North Hall, hyper-aware of the stares following me. Word traveled fast in boarding schools. The new senior transfer who got expelled from Choate. I'd be campus gossip by lunch.

A group of guys my age passed, their conversation cutting off abruptly when they saw me. One of them nodded politely, but I caught the whispered conversation that started as soon as they thought they were out of earshot.

"That's the new kid. Heard he got kicked out for vandalism."

"Vandalism" didn't quite cover it, but sure. Close enough.

North Hall was one of the older dorm buildings, brick and ivy with the kind of architectural character that came from being constructed in the 1920s. Inside, the hallway smelled like floor wax and teenage boys—a universal scent that transcended individual schools.

Room 214 was on the second floor, a double with one bed already claimed and decorated with posters and photographs. My roommate, whoever he was, had made himself at home. The other bed was bare, waiting for me with institutional efficiency.

I dropped my duffel bag on the unclaimed bed and looked around. The room was fine—better than fine, actually. Two desks, two dressers, decent-sized windows overlooking the quad. My parents would approve. They'd spent enough money to guarantee my comfort, if not my welcome.

I unpacked mechanically, not bothering to make the space personal. Clothes in the dresser, laptop and books on the desk, toiletries in the shared bathroom down the hall. I'd learned at Choate not to get too comfortable, not to put down roots. Easier to leave when everything was still half-packed. When you expected to fail, or to be asked to leave, there was no point decorating.

Three years at Choate, and I'd never fully unpacked either. Some part of me had always known I didn't quite fit, that eventually the careful performance of being the right kind of student would crack and reveal what was underneath—someone who questioned things, who couldn't just accept tradition and authority without examining whether they deserved respect.

And then the statue incident had happened, and that was that.

My phone buzzed. Text from my mother: *Hope first day is going well. Remember this is a fresh start. Make good choices.*

Fresh start. As if changing schools erased my history, as if these students would see me as anything other than damaged goods. As if I could just reinvent myself because my parents had written enough checks to secure my admission.

I typed back: *All fine. In the dorm.*

Another buzz, this time from my father: *Don't waste this opportunity. We've invested significant resources in your second chance.*

Invested. Not "we love you" or "we believe in you." Invested, like I was a stock that might or might not pay dividends. My parents had always been good at expressing expectations and disappointment, less skilled at unconditional support. The expulsion from Choate had confirmed their worst fears about me—that I was ungrateful, reckless, incapable of appreciating the opportunities they provided.

They didn't want to understand why I'd defaced that statue. They didn't care that the school founder had a documented history of racism, that naming a building after him was offensive. They only cared that I'd embarrassed them in front of donors and destroyed my chances at Yale.

I didn't respond to that one.

A notice had been slipped under the door—orientation assembly information, mandatory attendance, eleven o'clock in Morrison Hall. I checked my watch. Forty-five minutes.

I considered skipping. What were they going to do, expel me on day one? But Patterson's warning echoed: *One infraction.* Skipping mandatory assembly would probably qualify.

So I'd go. I'd sit in the back, keep my head down, and get through it. That was the plan for Riverside—survive senior year, get my diploma, get into college somewhere that hadn't heard about my Choate disaster, and finally escape my parents' disappointment.

I left North Hall and walked back across campus toward Morrison Hall, the main academic building. More students were out now, groups laughing and catching up after summer break. Nobody approached me. I was the unknown variable, the transfer student with a reputation.

Through the buildings, I caught glimpses of the Pemigewasset River, sunlight catching on the water. The natural setting was beautiful, I had to admit. If I'd come here under different circumstances, I might have actually wanted to be here.

Near Morrison Hall, I noticed a Victorian house set slightly apart from the other buildings, formal and well-maintained with a historical marker by the path. The Headmaster's Residence, according to the brass plaque.

I wondered what kind of person the headmaster was. Probably another Patterson type—rigid, traditional, committed to maintaining Riverside's precious reputation. Someone who saw students like me as threats to institutional order.

Morrison Hall's entrance was crowded with returning students greeting each other, sharing summer stories, the kind of easy camaraderie that came from years of shared experience. I sidestepped the groups and found my way to the assembly room—wood-paneled walls, rows of chairs facing a small stage, tall windows overlooking the campus.

I chose a seat in the back row, as far from attention as possible.

The room filled steadily. Students took seats in clusters—friend groups, sports teams, whatever social structures organized boarding school life. I sat alone, which was fine. Better than forcing conversation with people who'd already judged me.

Faculty members entered and took positions along the sides of the room, watching with the particular vigilance of teachers on the first day. I recognized Patterson among them, his eyes scanning the crowd and landing on me for a long moment before moving on.

Yeah. He'd be watching me all year.

The room was nearly full when a group of student council types entered and took seats on the stage. They wore the slightly self-important air of students with official responsibilities, blazers and serious expressions.

One girl caught my attention—she sat with perfect posture, hands folded in her lap, looking calm and prepared in a way that suggested she'd done this before. Dark hair pulled back neatly, minimal makeup, the kind of natural prettiness that didn't need effort. She looked... contained. Like she was very carefully managing how she appeared.

She also looked completely untouchable. Perfect student, perfect presentation, probably perfect life.

The kind of girl who'd never look twice at the expelled transfer student in the back row.

The assembly was about to begin.

And I was about to become officially, unavoidably, part of Riverside Academy.

Whether I liked it or not.
