# Chapter 27: Lakeside Resolution

After the formal ended at ten, a group of us headed down to Lakeside Point. It was a Riverside tradition—after major school events, students would gather by the river with a bonfire, talking and unwinding before curfew at midnight.

Tyler led the way with supplies he'd stashed earlier: firewood, matches, blankets. About fifteen students made the walk down the wooded path, still in our formal clothes, laughing and talking in the November cold.

"This is crazy," someone said. "It's freezing and we're in dresses and suits."

"That's the point," Tyler called back. "Tradition over comfort."

Noah walked beside me, his suit jacket draped over my shoulders for extra warmth. Meredith was ahead with Tyler, the two of them arguing about the best way to build a bonfire.

When we reached the clearing by the river, Tyler and a few other guys got to work on the fire while the rest of us arranged logs in a circle for seating. Within fifteen minutes, flames were crackling upward, casting orange light across the small clearing.

"Much better," Meredith said, holding her hands toward the warmth.

We settled onto the logs, the fire between us and the dark river beyond. Stars were visible overhead, brilliant in the clear November sky. The formal music and decorations felt far away. This was quieter, more intimate. Real.

Mr. Webb appeared about twenty minutes later, walking down the path with a flashlight.

"Just checking in," he said. "Making sure everyone's being safe and plans to make curfew."

"We will, Mr. Webb," Tyler promised.

"Good. I'll be in the faculty residence if anything goes wrong. Don't do anything that'll make me regret trusting you."

After he left, the conversation flowed easily. Students talked about the formal, about classes, about upcoming Thanksgiving break. The atmosphere was relaxed and happy.

Then Sloane appeared at the edge of the firelight.

Everyone went quiet.

She stood there in her dramatic red dress, looking uncertain for the first time since I'd known her.

"I just wanted to say..." She looked at Noah. "I'm sorry. For everything. For using your history against you. For making it harder for you here. That was wrong of me."

Noah studied her for a long moment. "Thank you for apologizing."

"I was angry about how things ended between us. But that wasn't an excuse to try to ruin your fresh start here."

"No, it wasn't."

The honesty seemed to surprise her. But then she nodded. "I hope... I hope things work out for you. Here. With everything."

She glanced at me briefly, then turned and walked back up the path toward campus.

"That was unexpected," Tyler said.

"That was closure," Noah corrected. "Finally."

The conversation picked up again, lighter now that the tension had passed. As the evening progressed and the fire burned lower, students started heading back to campus in pairs and small groups to make curfew.

By eleven-thirty, only eight of us remained: Me, Noah, Tyler, Meredith, and four other students from Noah's dorm. The fire had burned down to a comfortable level, glowing coals providing warmth without the intensity of the earlier flames.

"So," Tyler said, poking the fire with a stick and sending sparks upward into the dark sky. "Senior year. Halfway done. Crazy to think about. What are we all doing next year?"

"College," one of the other guys said. "Hopefully somewhere with better weather than New Hampshire. Somewhere I can wear shorts year-round."

"Traitor," Tyler said good-naturedly. "I'm staying local. UNH has a good program for what I want to study, and honestly? I like it here. New England feels like home now."

"Even the winters?" someone asked skeptically.

"Especially the winters. Character building. Makes you appreciate spring."

Meredith smiled. "I'm hoping for scholarship opportunities. Looking at schools in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Somewhere academically competitive but not too far from home."

"You'll get in anywhere you apply," I told her. "Your grades are perfect and you're amazing."

"What about you, Kelsey?" Tyler asked.

I thought about it. A month ago, I would have said whatever seemed most appropriate, most expected. But now?

"I'm thinking about schools farther away," I admitted. "Maybe New York or DC. Somewhere I can figure out who I am outside of being the headmaster's daughter. I've spent my whole life here at Riverside. I think I need some distance to discover who I am when nobody knows my history."

Noah's hand found mine. "That makes sense."

"What about you?" Meredith asked him.

Noah stared into the fire. "I don't know. That's new for me—not knowing but being okay with it. A few months ago, I was just focused on surviving each day, getting through senior year without another disaster. I wasn't thinking about the future because I couldn't see past tomorrow."

"And now?" I prompted gently.

"Now I'm actually thinking about possibilities. Maybe political science or history. Maybe a school where nobody knows about my past and I can just start fresh. Or maybe somewhere nearby." He squeezed my hand. "I'm not trying to run away anymore. That's progress."

"That's huge progress," Tyler said seriously. "When you got here in September, you were so guarded. Now look at you—sitting at a bonfire with friends, talking about the future, holding hands with the headmaster's daughter. Character development."

Everyone laughed, including Noah.

As eleven forty-five approached, the other students started gathering their things.

"We should head back," one said. "Curfew's in fifteen minutes."

Tyler stood up, brushing off his suit pants. "Meredith, want to walk back together?"

"Sure."

She gave me a significant look—the kind that said *we're leaving you two alone on purpose*—and followed Tyler up the path.

Suddenly it was just Noah and me by the dying fire, the river flowing dark beyond the firelight.

"They're not subtle," Noah observed.

"Not even a little bit."

We sat in comfortable silence, watching the embers glow. The November cold was sharp now that the fire was dying, but neither of us moved to leave.

"Tonight was perfect," Noah said eventually.

"It was."

"I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. For something to go wrong. But maybe... maybe things can just be good sometimes."

"They can. They are."

He turned to face me. "Kelsey, I know we're moving fast. We've only really been together a couple weeks. But I need you to know—what I feel for you isn't casual. This isn't just a high school romance that'll fade when we graduate."

My heart was pounding. "What is it then?"

"It's real. You're real. What we have is real." He took both my hands. "I don't know what happens after graduation. If we end up at schools on opposite coasts or if we stay close. But I know I want to try. To make this work. Because you're the first person who's ever made me want to build something instead of just surviving."

"I want that too," I said. "The real thing. Not perfect, not easy, but real."

"Are you scared?"

"Terrified. But the good kind of scared. The excited kind."

"Me too."

The fire was almost out now, just glowing embers. The river murmured in the darkness. Above us, stars wheeled across the November sky.

"We should probably head back," I said reluctantly. "Curfew's in five minutes."

"Probably."

But neither of us moved. We stayed there by the dying fire, hands linked, not wanting the night to end.

"Kelsey?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for seeing me. The real me. For fighting for me when no one else would. For making me believe I could have this—a normal life, real friends, someone who cares about me."

"You don't have to thank me for that."

"I do, though. You changed my life."

"You changed mine too. You made me braver. Made me want to actually live instead of just being perfect."

We finally stood, reluctantly leaving the warmth of the dying embers. Noah kicked dirt over the remaining coals, making sure everything was safe. Then we walked together up the path toward campus, his hand warm in mine.

The lights of Riverside Academy glowed ahead—dorm windows, pathway lights, the administration building with its clock tower showing eleven fifty-eight.

We had two minutes until curfew.

"I'll walk you to your dorm," Noah said.

"You'll be late getting back to yours."

"Worth it."

We reached South Hall just as the clock tower began chiming midnight. Noah pulled me close, and I wrapped my arms around him.

"Goodnight, Kelsey Morrison."

"Goodnight, Noah Bennett."

One more quick kiss, and then he was jogging across the quad toward North Hall, his suit jacket flapping behind him.

I watched him go, smiling like an idiot.

Meredith was waiting just inside the dorm entrance.

"So? How was the private bonfire time?"

"Perfect," I said. "Absolutely perfect."

"Good. You deserve perfect."

As we climbed the stairs to our room, I thought about how much had changed in just a few weeks. The girl I'd been at the start of senior year—careful, cautious, living for everyone else's expectations—felt like a stranger.

The girl I was now chose happiness over perfection. Chose truth over comfort. Chose Noah even though it was complicated.

And that girl? She was finally, genuinely living.
